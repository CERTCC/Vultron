# Embargo Lifecycle — Architecture and Implementation Notes

**Status**: Design decision — target architecture tracked in
[#538](https://github.com/CERTCC/Vultron/issues/538)
**See also**: `notes/embargo-default-semantics.md`,
`notes/participant-embargo-consent.md`

---

## Background

The embargo lifecycle involves three interacting state machines:

1. **EM** (`vultron/core/states/em.py`) — the case-level embargo state:
   `NONE → PROPOSED → ACTIVE ↔ REVISE → EXITED`
2. **PEC** (`vultron/core/states/participant_embargo_consent.py`) — the
   per-participant consent state, over `UNBOUND`, `INVITED`, `SIGNATORY`,
   `LAPSED`, `DECLINED`. `UNBOUND` means *the participant is not bound by any
   embargo terms*, so `ACCEPT`/`DECLINE` are valid directly from it — consent
   is not always mediated by an invitation (ADR-0048, ADR-0091, CM-18-003). See
   `notes/participant-embargo-consent.md` for the full transition table and
   the direct-assignment pitfall (CM-18-005).
3. **`VulnerabilityCase.active_embargo`** — the pointer to the currently
   active `VultronEmbargoEvent` object

A correct embargo lifecycle transition must update **all three** consistently.

---

## Current Architecture (Implemented)

`EmbargoLifecycle` exists at `vultron/core/services/embargo_lifecycle.py` and
owns all EM + PEC transition logic (implemented per
[#538](https://github.com/CERTCC/Vultron/issues/538),
[#746](https://github.com/CERTCC/Vultron/issues/746),
[#747](https://github.com/CERTCC/Vultron/issues/747)).

**Actual public interface**:

```python
class EmbargoLifecycle:
    def __init__(self, persistence: CasePersistence) -> None: ...
    def propose_embargo(
        self, *, case_id, embargo_id, actor_id, transition_mode=STRICT
    ) -> EmbargoLifecycleResult: ...
    def accept_embargo_invite(
        self, *, case_id, embargo_id, actor_id, transition_mode=STRICT
    ) -> EmbargoLifecycleResult: ...
    def reject_embargo_invite(
        self, *, case_id, embargo_id, actor_id, transition_mode=STRICT
    ) -> EmbargoLifecycleResult: ...
    def terminate_active_embargo(
        self, *, case_id, actor_id, transition_mode=STRICT
    ) -> EmbargoLifecycleResult: ...
    def activate_embargo(
        self, *, case_id, embargo_id, actor_id=None, transition_mode=STRICT
    ) -> EmbargoLifecycleResult: ...
    def record_participant_consent(
        self, *, case_id, actor_id, pec_trigger, embargo_id=None
    ) -> EmbargoLifecycleResult: ...
```

**`TransitionMode`**: `STRICT` enforces valid transitions and precondition
guards (used by trigger-side BT behaviors).  `OBSERVED` syncs local state
unconditionally to match a remote party's assertion (used by received-side use
cases — bypasses all guards).

**P/X/A embargo-eligibility guards** (added in
[#1454](https://github.com/CERTCC/Vultron/issues/1454)): `EmbargoLifecycle`
enforces EMB-01-002, EMB-02-002, and EMB-04-002 via
`_assert_pxa_embargo_eligible()` in STRICT mode:

- `propose_embargo()` — raises when `pxa_state != CS_pxa.pxa` (any of P/X/A set)
- `accept_embargo_invite()` — raises when owner would drive EM to ACTIVE with
  P/X/A set; non-owner consent recording is not blocked
- `reject_embargo_invite()` — raises when EM is REVISE and P/X/A is set (caller
  MUST use `terminate_active_embargo()` instead)

The received-side path (`received/embargo.py`) does not use `EmbargoLifecycle`
for EM state transitions (those still use inline BT execution), but EMB-01-002
and EMB-02-002 are enforced as explicit pre-flight guards in
`InviteToEmbargoOnCaseReceivedUseCase.execute()` and
`AcceptInviteToEmbargoOnCaseReceivedUseCase.execute()` respectively (implemented
in [#1484](https://github.com/CERTCC/Vultron/issues/1484)). Migrating the
received-side EM transitions to `EmbargoLifecycle` (AC-3 of #1484) is still
pending.

**Auto-terminate on publication** (CS.P/X/A event): handled by
`PublicDisclosureBranchNode` in `vultron/core/behaviors/status/nodes/lifecycle.py`.
The node is a Selector with two arms depending on the current EM state:

- **EM ACTIVE or REVISE** → delegates to `terminate_embargo_bt` (ET + EM →
  EXITED). This is the cascade path for AC-2 of issue #1454.
- **EM PROPOSED** → delegates to `reject_proposed_embargo_bt` (ER + EM →
  NONE). EMB-16-001: continuing to negotiate a proposed embargo after
  P/X/A is set is not viable; the proposal must be abandoned immediately.
- **EM NONE or EXITED** → skip (nothing to tear down).

Prior to the fix in issue #1892, the skip condition used
`case.active_embargo is None` to detect "no embargo", which silently bypassed
the PROPOSED arm — `active_embargo` is always None when EM is PROPOSED because
the embargo has not yet been activated. The fix checks EM state directly.

Trigger use cases are thin orchestrators: resolve actors/cases → call
`EmbargoLifecycle` → build and send the outbound activity.
BT behaviors use `ProposeEmbargoLifecycleNode`, `AcceptEmbargoLifecycleNode`,
`RejectEmbargoLifecycleNode`, and `TerminateEmbargoLifecycleNode` which all
catch `VultronError` and return `Status.FAILURE`.

## Guidance for Agents

When implementing any code that transitions embargo state:

1. **Always use `EmbargoLifecycle`** (`vultron/core/services/embargo_lifecycle.py`).
   Never instantiate `create_em_machine()` + `EMAdapter` inline.
   BT nodes MUST NOT directly assign `EmDimension` to `case.current_status.em`
   and call `dl.save(case)` as a substitute — route through `EmbargoLifecycle`
   instead (EMB-18-001). Warning-only `is_valid_em_transition()` guards that
   proceed regardless of result MUST NOT be used (EMB-18-002).
2. **P/X/A precondition**: STRICT mode guards `propose_embargo()` and
   `accept_embargo_invite()` (owner-only) against PXA-set cases.  If your
   caller receives `VultronInvalidStateTransitionError`, the case is no longer
   embargo-eligible — do not attempt to retry; emit ER to the proposer.
3. **REVISE+PXA reject**: `reject_embargo_invite()` raises in STRICT mode when
   EM is REVISE and P/X/A is set — the correct path is
   `terminate_active_embargo()` per EMB-04-002.
4. **PEC cascade is automatic**: `propose_embargo()` cascades `SIGNATORY →
   LAPSED` on `ACTIVE → REVISE`; `terminate_active_embargo()` resets all PEC
   to `UNBOUND`. Callers do not need to do this manually.
5. **OBSERVED mode** (received-side): pass
   `transition_mode=TransitionMode.OBSERVED` to sync local state with a remote
   assertion. All guards and PEC cascades are bypassed in OBSERVED mode.
6. **PROPOSED + P/X/A**: when a CS public/exploit/attacks event fires while EM
   is PROPOSED, use `reject_proposed_embargo_bt` (not `terminate_embargo_bt`).
   `terminate_embargo_bt` requires an active embargo (`HasActiveEmbargoNode`
   guard); it fails when EM is PROPOSED. `reject_proposed_embargo_bt` calls
   `reject_embargo_invite()` which handles PROPOSED → NONE correctly
   (EMB-16-001).
