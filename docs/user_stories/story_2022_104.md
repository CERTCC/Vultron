# User Story `2022_104` #

<!-- story-start -->As a Participant, I want to address multiple related vulnerabilities across multiple vendors simultaneously.<!-- story-end -->

## Notes ##

*(as of v0.4.0)*
This story represents MPCVD in hard mode. But there are two ways to approach it: As a single case, or as individual cases with correlated states. The latter is essentially a post-split version of the former. Either way should work, but the Participants will need to maintain a degree of sync across cases if the case is split. GI messages carry most of the burden here.
