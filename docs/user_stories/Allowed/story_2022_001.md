# User Story `2022_001` #

As a Finder I want to discover how to report a vulnerability so that I can notify the affected vendors and start CVD

## Notes ##

*(as of v0.4.0)*
Reporting is provided, but endpoint discovery is not

With an ActivityPub-based solution, this could be as simple as a vendor or CVD service provider listing
their inbox as a public property of their profile. This would allow Finders to discover the endpoint.
