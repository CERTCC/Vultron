# User Story `2022_086` #

As a Participant I will prioritize my response to requests for information or action so that I contribute to a risk-minimizing CVD process and outcome

## Notes ##

*(as of v0.4.0)*
The RM process requires that Participants prioritize valid cases. The protocol does not dictate what prioritization scheme is used.
