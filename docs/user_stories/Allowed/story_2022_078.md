# User Story `2022_078` #

As a coordinator, I want to drive better (shorter?) embargo timelines, to ensure they are feasible.

## Notes ##

*(as of v0.4.0)*
The EM process describes a tendency toward shorter embargoes, but does not require it. Individual Participants are free to negotiate embargoes according to their own policy and values.
