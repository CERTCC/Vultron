# Interactions Between the Vultron Protocol and SSVC

{% include-markdown "../includes/not_normative.md" %}

In the context of the Vultron Protocol, once a report has been validated
(i.e., it is in the RM [_Valid_](../topics/process_models/rm/index.md#the-valid-v-state) state, $q^{rm} \in V$), it must be prioritized to 
determine what further effort, if any, is necessary. 
While any prioritization scheme might be used, here we demonstrate an application of the [SSVC](https://github.com/CERTCC/SSVC) model.

## SSVC Supplier and Deployer Trees

The default outcomes for both the SSVC [_Supplier_](https://github.com/CERTCC/SSVC/blob/v2.1/doc/graphics/ssvc_2_supplier.pdf)
and [_Deployer_](https://github.com/CERTCC/SSVC/blob/v2.1/doc/graphics/ssvc_2_deployer_SeEUMss.pdf) Trees are
_Defer_, _Scheduled_, _Out of Cycle_, and _Immediate_.
The mapping from SSVC outcomes to RM states is straightforward, as shown below for the _Supplier Tree_ and
the _Deployer Tree_.

!!! note "SSVC _Supplier Tree_ Mapping to RM States"

    $$\label{eq:ssvc_supplier_tree_output}
    q^{rm} \in
    \begin{cases}
        \xrightarrow{d} D & \text{when } SSVC(Supplier~Tree) = Defer \\
        \\
        \xrightarrow{a} A & \text{when } SSVC(Supplier~Tree) \in  
        \begin{Bmatrix}
            Scheduled \\
            Out~of~Cycle \\
            Immediate \\
        \end{Bmatrix} \\
    \end{cases}$$

!!! note "SSVC _Deployer Tree_ Mapping to RM States"
    
    $$\label{eq:ssvc_deployer_tree_output}
    q^{rm} \in
    \begin{cases}
        \xrightarrow{d} D & \text{when } SSVC(Deployer~Tree) = Defer \\
        \\
        \xrightarrow{a} A & \text{when } SSVC(Deployer~Tree) \in  
        \begin{Bmatrix}
            Scheduled \\
            Out~of~Cycle \\
            Immediate \\
        \end{Bmatrix} \\
    \end{cases}$$

The
SSVC _Defer_
output maps directly onto the RM [_Deferred_](../topics/process_models/rm/index.md#the-deferred-d-state) state.
Otherwise, the three outputs that imply further action is necessary&mdash;Scheduled_,
_Out-of-Cycle_, and _Immediate_&mdash;all proceed to the RM [_Accepted_](../topics/process_models/rm/index.md#the-accepted-a-state) state.
The different categories imply different processes within the _Accepted_ state.
But because the RM model does not dictate internal organizational processes, further description of what those processes
might look like is out of scope for this crosswalk.

We remind readers of a key takeaway from the protocol requirements in
the main part of this documentation:

!!! note ""
 
    Vendors SHOULD communicate their prioritization choices when making
    either a _defer_ ($\{V,A\} \xrightarrow{d} D$) or _accept_
    ($\{V,D\} \xrightarrow{a} A$) transition out of the _Valid_,
    _Deferred_, or _Accepted_ states.

## SSVC Coordinator Trees

SSVC version 2 offers two decision trees for Coordinators: A [_Coordinator Triage Tree_](https://github.com/CERTCC/SSVC/blob/v2.1/doc/graphics/ssvc_2_coord-triage.pdf)
and a [_Coordinator Publish Tree_](https://github.com/CERTCC/SSVC/blob/v2.1/doc/graphics/ssvc_2_coord-publish.pdf).
The outputs for the _Coordinator Triage_ Decision Tree are _Decline_, _Track_, and _Coordinate_.
Similar to the _Supplier Tree_ mapping above, the mapping here is simple, as shown below.

!!! note "SSVC _Coordinator Triage Tree_ Mapped to RM States"

    $$\label{eq:ssvc_coordinator_triage_tree_output}
    q^{rm} \in
    \begin{cases}
        \xrightarrow{d} D & \text{when } SSVC(Coord.~Triage~Tree) = Decline \\
        \\
        \xrightarrow{a} A & \text{when } SSVC(Coord.~Triage~Tree) \in  
        \begin{Bmatrix}
            Track \\
            Coordinate \\
        \end{Bmatrix} \\
    \end{cases}$$


Again, whereas the _Decline_ output maps directly to the RM [_Deferred_](../topics/process_models/rm/index.md#the-deferred-d-state) state, the remaining two
states (_Track_ and _Coordinate_) imply the necessity for distinct processes within the Coordinator's RM [_Accepted_](../topics/process_models/rm/index.md#the-accepted-a-state) state.

On the other hand, the SSVC _Coordinator Publish Tree_ falls entirely within the Coordinator's _Accepted_ state, so its 
output does not directly induce any Coordinator RM state transitions.
However, a number of its decision points *do* touch on the protocol models, which we cover next.

## SSVC Decision Points and the Vultron Protocol

Additional connections between the protocol and the SSVC decision trees are possible.
We now examine how individual SSVC tree decision points can inform or be informed by Participant states in the
Vultron Protocol.

### Exploitation

The SSVC _Exploitation_ decision point permits three possible values:

- _None_
- _PoC_
- _Active_

These values map directly onto state subsets in the [Case State (CS) model](../topics/process_models/cs/index.md), as shown below.

!!! note "SSVC _Exploitation_ Decision Point Mapped to CS States"

    $$ SSVC(exploitation) =
    \begin{cases}
        None & \iff q^{cs} \in \cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot xa \\
        PoC & \iff  q^{cs} \in \cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot Xa \\
        Active & \iff q^{cs} \in \cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot A \\
    \end{cases}$$

A value of _None_ implies that no exploits have been made public, and no attacks have been observed
(i.e., $q^{cs} \in \cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot xa$).
The _PoC_ value means that an exploit is public, but no attacks have been observed 
(i.e., $q^{cs} \in \cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot Xa$). 
Finally, the _Active_ value indicates attacks are occurring
(i.e., $q^{cs} \in \cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot A$).
These case states and SSVC values are equivalent in both directions, hence our use of the "if-and-only-if" ($\iff$) symbol.


### Report Public

The SSVC _Report Public_ decision point also maps directly onto the [CS model](../topics/process_models/cs/index.md).
A value of _Yes_ means that the report is public, equivalent to $q^{cs} \in \cdot\cdot\cdot P \cdot\cdot$.
On the other hand, a _No_ value is the same as $q^{cs} \in \cdot\cdot\cdot p \cdot\cdot$.
As above, "$\iff$" indicates the bidirectional equivalence.

!!! note "SSVC _Report Public_ Decision Point Mapped to CS States"

    $$SSVC(report~public) = 
    \begin{cases}
        Yes & \iff q^{cs} \in \cdot\cdot\cdot P \cdot\cdot \\
        No & \iff q^{cs} \in \cdot\cdot\cdot p \cdot\cdot \\
    \end{cases}$$

### Supplier Contacted

If the Supplier (Vendor) has been notified (i.e., there is reason to believe they are at least in the RM [_Received_](../topics/process_models/rm/index.md#the-received-r-state) 
state, equivalent to the $V\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot$ CS state subset) the _Supplier Contacted_ value should be _Yes_,
otherwise it should be _No_.

!!! note "SSVC _Supplier Contacted_ Decision Point Mapped to RM States"

    $$SSVC(supp.~contacted) = 
    \begin{cases}
        Yes & \iff q^{rm}_{Vendor} \not \in S \text{ or } q^{cs}_{Vendor} \in V\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot \\
        \\
        No & \iff q^{rm}_{Vendor} \in S \text{ or } q^{cs}_{Vendor} \in vfd \cdot\cdot\cdot \\
    \end{cases}$$


### Report Credibility

Unlike most of the other SSVC decision points covered here that form a part of a Participant's report prioritization 
process *after* report validation, the _Report Credibility_ decision point forms an important step in the Coordinator's
validation process.
In fact, it is often the only validation step possible when the Coordinator lacks the ability to reproduce a
vulnerability whether due to constraints of resources, time, or skill.
Thus, a value of _Credible_ can be expected to lead to an RM transition to [_Valid_](../topics/process_models/rm/index.md#the-valid-v-state) ($q^{rm} \in R \xrightarrow{v} V$),
assuming any additional validation checks also pass. 
On the contrary, _Not-Credible_ always implies the RM transition to [_Invalid_](../topics/process_models/rm/index.md#the-invalid-i-state) ($q^{rm} \in R \xrightarrow{i} I$) 
because "Valid-but-not-Credible" is a contradiction.

!!! note "SSVC _Report Credibility_ Decision Point Mapped to RM States"

    $$SSVC(report~cred.) = 
    \begin{cases}
        Credible & \text{implies }q^{rm} \xrightarrow{v} V \textrm{ (if validation also passes)}\\
        Not~Credible & \text{implies } q^{rm} \xrightarrow{i} I \\
    \end{cases}$$

### Supplier Engagement

The possible values for the _Supplier_ (Vendor) _Engagement_ decision point are _Active_ or _Unresponsive_.
From the Coordinator's perspective, if enough Suppliers in a CVD case have communicated their engagement in a case
(i.e., enough Vendors are in the RM _Accepted_ state already or are expected to make it there soon from either the
_Received_ or _Valid_ states), then the SSVC value would be _Active_.

Vendors in _Invalid_ or _Closed_ can be taken as disengaged, and it might be appropriate to select _Unresponsive_ for 
the SSVC _Engagement_ decision point.

Vendors in either _Received_ or _Deferred_ might be either _Active_ or _Unresponsive_, depending on the specific report
history.

This mapping is formalized below and in the figure that follows.

!!! note "SSVC _Supplier Engagement_ Decision Point Mapped to RM States"

    $$ SSVC(supp.~eng.) = 
    \begin{cases}
        Active & \text{if } q^{rm} \in \{A,V\} \\
        \\
        \begin{cases}
            Active \\
            Unresponsive
        \end{cases} & \text{if } q^{rm} \in \{R,D\} \\
        \\
        Unresponsive & \text{if } q^{rm} \in \{I,C,S\} \\
    \end{cases}$$

    S --> Unresponsive
```

### Supplier Involvement

The _Supplier Involvement_ decision point can take on the values _Fix-Ready_, _Cooperative_, or _Uncooperative/Unresponsive_.
We begin by noting the equivalence of the _Fix-Ready_ value with the similarly named substate of the CS model.

!!! note "SSVC _Supplier Involvement_ Decision Point Mapped to CS States"

    $$\begin{aligned}
    \label{eq:ssvc_supplier_involvement_fr}
        SSVC(supp.~inv.) = Fix~Ready \iff q^{cs} \in VF \cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot
    \end{aligned}$$

The Vendor RM states map onto these values as formalized below and shown in the figure below.

!!! note "SSVC Supplier Involvement Decision Point Mapped to Vendor RM States"

    $$\begin{aligned}
    \label{eq:ssvc_supplier_involvement}
    SSVC(supp.~inv.) = 
    \begin{cases}
        \begin{cases}
            Fix~Ready \\
            Cooperative
        \end{cases} & \text{if } q^{rm} \in A \\
        \\
        Cooperative & \text{if } q^{rm} \in V \\
        \\
        Uncoop./Unresp. & \text{if } q^{rm} \in \{R,I,D,C,S\} \\
    \end{cases}

!!! tip "_Engagement_ vs. _Involvement_: What's the Difference?"

    Note the discrepancy between the mappings given for SSVC _Supplier Engagement_ versus those for _Supplier Involvement_.
    This distinction is most prominent in the connections from the _Received_ and _Deferred_ RM states in the two figures above.
    These differences are the result of the relative timing of the two different decisions they support within a CVD case.

    The decision to Coordinate (i.e., whether the Coordinator should move from RM _Valid_ to RM _Accept_ 
    ($q^{rm} \in V \xrightarrow{a} A$) occurs early in the Coordinator's RM process.
    The SSVC _Supplier Engagement_ decision point is an attempt to capture this information.
    This early in the process, allowances must be made for Vendors who may not have completed their own validation or 
    prioritization processes. 
    Hence, the mapping allows Vendors in any valid yet unclosed state ($q^{rm} \in \{R,V,A,D\}$) to be categorized as 
    _Active_ for this decision point.


    On the other hand, the decision to Publish&mdash;a choice that falls entirely within the Coordinator's RM _Accepted_ 
    state&mdash;occurs later, at which time, more is known about each Vendor's level of involvement in the case
    to that point. 
    By the time the publication decision is made, the Vendor(s) have had ample opportunity to engage in the CVD process.
    They might already have a _Fix-Ready_ ($q^{cs} \in VF \cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot$), or they might be working toward it
    (i.e., SSVC _Cooperative_).
    However, if the Coordinator has reached the point where they are making a publication decision, and the Vendor has 
    yet to actively engage in the case for whatever reason&mdash;as indicated by their failure to reach the RM 
    _Accepted_ state or demonstrate progress toward it by at least getting to RM _Valid_ 
    ($q^{rm} \in \{A,V\}$)&mdash;then they can be categorized as _Uncooperative/Unresponsive_.
