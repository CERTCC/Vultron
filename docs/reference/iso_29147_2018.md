# ISO/IEC 29147:2018

Similarly, {== ISO/IEC 29147:2018 ==} also overlaps with our proposed MPCVD protocol.

!!! tip "Consistent Terminology"

    Our use of the following terms is consistent with ISO/IEC 29147:2018
    _§5.4 Systems, components, and services_: Systems, Components, Products, Services, Vulnerability, and Product interdependency.

    ISO/IEC 29147:2018 _§5.5 Stakeholder Roles_ includes _User_, _Vendor_, _Reporter_, and _Coordinator_.
    We generally use _Deployer_ instead of _User_, but the rest are consistent. 

Perhaps unsurprisingly, clauses 5 through 9 of ISO/IEC 29147:2018 overlap significantly with our proposed MPCVD protocol.
See the table below for a thorough cross-reference.
