# Vultron Protocol Reference

!!! tip inline end "Prerequisites"

    The [Reference](index.md) section assumes that you have

    - specific questions about or a desire for a detailed understanding of the Vultron Protocol
    - familiarity with the [Understanding Vultron](../topics/index.md) section
    - familiarity with the CVD process in general
     
    If you are unfamiliar with the Vultron Protocol, we recommend that you start with [Understanding Vultron](../topics/index.md).
    If you are familiar enough with the Vultron Protocol that you're interested in implementing it, see [Implementing Vultron](../howto/index.md).
    And finally, if you're just trying to understand the CVD process, we recommend that you start with the [CERT Guide to Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure](https://vuls.cert.org/confluence/display/CVD/).
