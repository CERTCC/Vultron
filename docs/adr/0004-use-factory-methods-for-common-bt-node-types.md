# Use factory methods for common BT node types

## Context and Problem Statement

We have a number of common BT node types that are used in multiple trees.  We want to be able to create these nodes
in a consistent way, and we want to be able to easily change the implementation of these nodes without having to
change the code that creates them.

## Decision Drivers

- We want to be able to create these nodes in a consistent way
-Preserve future flexibility to change the underlying BT node implementation without having to change the code that creates them

## Considered Options

- No factory methods, directly subclass the BT node types
- Use factory methods

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Use factory methods", because it allows us to create the nodes in a consistent way, and it allows us to
change the underlying implementation without having to change the code that creates them.

### Consequences

Good because:

- retains flexibility to change the underlying implementation without having to change the code that creates them
- allows us to create the nodes in a consistent way
- allows us to keep the `vultron.bt.base` module clean and focused on the base classes
- allows us to keep the rest of the `vultron.bt` module focused on Vultron-specific needs

Neutral because:

- Adds a central place to maintain the factory methods

Bad because:

- less pythonic than just subclassing the BT node types

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### No factory methods

Good because:

- more pythonic

Bad because:

- Harder to enforce consistency in how the nodes are created

## More Information

This decision was inspired in part by the `py_trees` [documentation](https://py-trees.readthedocs.io/en/devel/the_crazy_hospital.html)
(in the context of composite nodes):

> Donâ€™t subclass merely to auto-populate it, build a create_<xyz>_subtree() library instead

Which got us thinking about using factory methods to help maintain a clean separation between the `vultron.bt.base`
module and the things that live above it.
