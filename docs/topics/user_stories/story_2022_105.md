# User Story `2022_105` #

<!-- story-start -->As a Vendor, I want to address the same vulnerability in multiple products but on different timelines so that I can avoid delaying the delivery of a ready fix to a subset of my user base.<!-- story-end -->

## Notes ##

*(as of v0.4.0)*
The vendor treating the case as multiple reports is doable within the current protocol. It makes the embargo negotiation a bit more complex, but we address that in the case split/merger discussion in the embargo chapter.
