<!-- story-start -->As a Participant, I want the coordination process to be decentralized so that it is robust against individual Participant actions.<!-- story-end -->

## Notes ##

*(as of v0.4.0)*
The protocol does not impose a structure to its implementation aside from the assumption that case participants are in a shared broadcast domain. This should work equally well whether individual participants follow a "copy all" approach using any communication channel or if they agree to use a centrally located resource following a blackboard pattern.
