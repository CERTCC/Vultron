<!-- story-start -->As a VDP operator, I want the CVD protocol to also support VDP<!-- story-end -->

## Notes ##

*(as of v0.4.0)*
The RM, EM, and CS processes are common to both CVD and VDP processes. It is somewhat unclear what specifically the difference is that this story is meant to address. The protocol notes that embargoes are not NDAs, and is mute on bounty payment mechanisms.
