# User Stories

{% include-markdown "../../includes/not_normative.md" %}

The Vultron Protocol is designed to support a variety of use cases.
The following user stories are intended to capture the requirements of these use cases.
While the protocol is designed to support these use cases, it is not required that all use cases be supported by the
protocol.

Where appropriate, we intend to provide a reference implementation for each applicable user story.

!!! info "Original User Stories from 2022 CERT/CC Whitepaper"

    Stories numbered from `2022_001` through `2022_102` originated in
    the [Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure User Stories](https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/library/asset-view.cfm?assetid=886543)
    whitepaper.
    
    > These user stories reflect
    > internal discussions with the CERT/Coordination Center (CC) based on our own experiences in developing and using the
    > VINCE platform as well as our ongoing CVD practices. The user stories are expected to be utilized by the CVD team to
    > better understand, create, and implement a CVD Protocol. In addition, the CERT/CC believes that these user cases will
    > be useful for any enterprise designing or implementing its own CVD policies, processes, and procedures.
    
    The remaining stories have been added since that whitepaper was published.

## Support Levels

Each story page indicates a categorization according to the level of support provided
by the originally published Vultron Protocol (version 0.4.0):

- _Provided_ - Stories in this category are directly supported by the Vultron Protocol v0.4.0.
- _Allowed_ - Stories in this category are indirectly supported by the Vultron Protocol v0.4.0.
- _Unsupported_ - Stories in this category are not supported by the Vultron Protocol v0.4.0.
- _Out-of-scope_ - Stories in this category are out of scope for the Vultron Protocol v0.4.0.

In the future, we expect these categories will change toward simply _Supported_, _Unsupported_ and _Out-of-scope_.
We also anticipate that as we learn more about ActivityPub and make progress on the protocol development, some of
the stories in the _Unsupported_ category could move to _Supported_.
