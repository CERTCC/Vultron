<!-- story-start -->As a Participant, I want to publicly disclose sooner than others but minimize their (the others) exposure/risk<!-- story-end -->

## Notes ##

*(as of v0.4.0)*
The protocol allows for any Participant to exit an embargo or case at any time. An ET message should be emitted as appropriate to signal the immediate termination of an embargo. An EV message may be emitted to provide advance warning of an intent to end an embargo early. The EM process recommends a few heuristics for resolving embargo proposals. The protocol does not provide a publication mechanism.
