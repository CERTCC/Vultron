# User Story `2022_023` #

<!-- story-start -->As a Participant, I want to constrain whom I communicate with because I want to enforce an embargo and communicate only with those who have a need to know.<!-- story-end -->

## Notes ##

*(as of v0.4.0)*
The protocol does not dictate who gets to be a case Participant. That needs to be decided on a per-case, per-Participant level.
