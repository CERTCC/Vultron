# User Story `2022_099` #

<!-- story-start -->As a Participant I want to communicate with non-vendor Participants, primarily other defenders, providers, CSIRTs, regulators, etc., important information. <!-- story-end -->

## Notes ##

*(as of v0.4.0)*
The protocol does not dictate who gets to be a case Participant. That needs to be decided on a per-case, per-Participant level.
