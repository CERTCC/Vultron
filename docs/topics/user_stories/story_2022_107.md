# User Story `2022_107` #

<!-- story-start -->As a Vendor, I want to convey the vulnerability status of my component(s), product(s), or service(s) to other Participants.<!-- story-end -->

## Notes ##

*(as of v0.4.0)*
The protocol doesn't directly reflect a Vendor or product's vulnerability status. Instead, it reflects the Vendor's status with respect to the Report. We expect that each RM message type will be accompanied by content that indicates any reasons or necessary explanation for why a particular state change occurred. E.g., "RI: report is invalid because none of our products are affected." Or "RV: This report affects the following of our products..."
