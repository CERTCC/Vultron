# Receiving and Processing Messages Behavior

Now we return to the [CVD Behavior Tree](cvd_bt.md) to pick up the last unexplored branch, Receive Messages.
The Receive Messages Behavior Tree is shown below.

    At this level, the behavior tree is modeling a basic queue servicing loop.
    There is nothing particularly special about this loop, and we probably wouldn't recommend 
    implementing a queue servicing loop with a behavior tree anyway. Instead, we're using this loop to represent
    that there is _some_ process by which individual messages are received and processed.
    The important part of this tree are the message-type specific behaviors that follow.

The tree represents a loop that continues until all currently received messages have been processed.
Each iteration checks for unprocessed messages and handles them.

First, we encounter a case closure check. We assume that messages to
existing cases will have a case ID associated with all messages about
that case and that new report submissions will not have a case ID
assigned yet, implying they are in the RM *Start* state ($q^{rm} \in S$).
Therefore, new reports will pass this check every time. However,
messages received on an already *Closed* case will short-circuit here
and take no further action.

Assuming the message is regarding a new or unclosed case and the message
has not yet been processed, each message type is handled by a
process-specific Behavior Tree, which we discuss in the following
sections. Although each process-specific behavior is described in a
subsection and shown in its own figure, they are all part of the same
fallback node shown here.
