# Process EM Messages Behavior {#sec:process_em_messages_bt}

The Process EM
Messages Behavior Tree is shown in Figure
{== [\[fig:bt_process_em_messages\]](#fig:bt_process_em_messages){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:bt_process_em_messages"} ==}. As above, it is a child of the
fallback node started in Figure
{== [\[fig:bt_receive_messages\]](#fig:bt_receive_messages){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:bt_receive_messages"} ==}. A precondition check for
EM message types is
followed by a fallback node. EM acknowledgment messages (_EK_) receive no
further attention and return *Success*.

## Messages That Lead to a Simple Acknowledgment.

Next is a branch handling all the messages that will result in a simple
acknowledgment (_EK_). First, we handle embargo error messages (_EE_),
which additionally trigger a general inquiry (_GI_) message to attempt
to resolve the problem. Second are embargo termination messages (_ET_).
If the Participant is already in the EM *eXited* state (_X_), no further action
is taken (aside from the _EK_). Otherwise, if the Participant is in
either *Active* or *Revise* EM states, the _ET_ message triggers a state
transition $q^{em} \xrightarrow{t} X$. Embargo rejections are handled
next in a simple sequence that returns the state from *Proposed* to
*None*.

The final chunk of the simple acknowledge branch handles
EM messages received
when the case state permits embargo viability
($q^{cs} \in \cdot\cdot\cdot pxa$). A variety of actions can be taken in this
case state, as shown in the lower ($\diamondsuit$) tier of Figure
{== [\[fig:bt_process_em_messages\]](#fig:bt_process_em_messages){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:bt_process_em_messages"} ==}. An embargo proposal (_EP_)
results in either a move from *None* to *Proposed* or stays in
*Proposed*, if that was already the case. An embargo acceptance (_EA_)
transitions from *Proposed* to *Active*. Similar to the _EP_ behavior,
an embargo revision proposal (_EV_) either moves from *Active* to
*Revise* or stays in *Revise*, as appropriate. Finally, we deal with
revision rejection (_EJ_) or acceptance (_EC_) when in the *Revise*
state. Climbing back up the tree, we see that *Success* in any of the
branches in this or the previous paragraph results in an acknowledgment
message _EK_.

## Messages That Require More than a Simple Acknowledgment.

Returning to the top portion of the tree in Figure
{== [\[fig:bt_process_em_messages\]](#fig:bt_process_em_messages){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:bt_process_em_messages"} ==}, we come to a branch focused on
handling EM messages
when an embargo is no longer viable---in other words, when the case has
reached a point where attacks are occurring, or either the exploit or
the vulnerability has been made public
($q^{cs} \not \in \cdot\cdot\cdot pxa$). This branch takes us to the Terminate
Embargo tree in Figure
{== [\[fig:bt_terminate\]](#fig:bt_terminate){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:bt_terminate"} ==}
(ยง{== [1.4.2](#sec:terminate_embargo_behavior){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec:terminate_embargo_behavior"} ==}).

Finally, back at the top of Figure
{== [\[fig:bt_process_em_messages\]](#fig:bt_process_em_messages){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:bt_process_em_messages"} ==}, when no other branch has
succeeded, we emit an embargo error (_EE_) message to relay the failure.
