# Report Closure Behavior

The Report Closure Behavior Tree is shown below.
As usual, the post-condition is checked before proceeding.
(A) If the case is already *Closed* ($q^{rm} \in C$), we're done.
Otherwise, (B) the main close sequence begins with a check for whether the report closure criteria have been met.
Report closure criteria are Participant-specific and are, therefore, out of scope for this specification.
Nevertheless, once those closure criteria are met, the actual *close report* task is activated (e.g., an `OnClose` callback).
The sequence ends with setting the state to *Closed* ($q^{rm} \xrightarrow{c} C$) and emitting an $RC$ message.
