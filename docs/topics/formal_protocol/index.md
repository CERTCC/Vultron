# Formal Protocol Summary

We provide a full description of the Vultron Protocol in the
[Formal Protocol](../../reference/formal_protocol/index.md) section.
For those who are already familiar with the Vultron Protocol and want a quick reference, we provide a summary here.
For those more interested in implementation than the formal details, we also provide a
[Worked Example](worked_example.md) in the form of sequence diagrams.

The remainder of this page is a summary of the formal protocol condensed from the full description
provided in the [Formal Protocol](../../reference/formal_protocol/index.md) section.
