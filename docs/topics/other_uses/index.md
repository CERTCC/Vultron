# Other Uses of the Vultron Case State Model

In this section, we discuss some potential uses of the Vultron case state model
that are not directly related to CVD case management.

- [CVD Roles and their influence](roles_influence.md) surveys the stakeholders in
CVD and how they might use our model; the stakeholders are vendors, system owners, the
security research community, coordinators, and governments.
- [Policy Formalization](policy_formalization.md) discusses the potential for
formalizing disclosure policy specifications using the model.

Other topics that may be of interest include:

- [Improving Definitions of Common Terms](zero_day.md) offers formal definitions of some common terms in vulnerability disclosure.
- [Vulnerability Response Situation Awareness](situation_awareness.md)
- Notes regarding the [Vulnerability Equities Process](vep.md) in relation to this model
- A set of [Recommended Action Rules for CVD](action_rules.md) based on case states
