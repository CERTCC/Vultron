# Future Work

Here we review a number of items remaining as future work.
In the following pages you'll find:

- A discussion of the need for a [CVD Directory](cvd_directory.md) and some of the difficulties it
might pose
- A few ideas to [reward efficient behavior](reward_functions.md) elaborating on the concept of churn in the RM and EM processes 
- Brief thoughts on the potential [use of ontologies](ontology.md) for process interoperability 
- Ideas for future [modeling and simulation](mod_sim.md) to further improve the MPCVD process
