!!! info "CVD Embargoes Are Not NDAs"

    CVD embargoes are *not* Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs).
    An NDA (also known as a Confidentiality agreement) is a legally binding contract between parties, often accompanied
    by a reward for compliance and/or some penalty in the event of unauthorized disclosure.
    NDAs do, on occasion, have a place in CVD processes, but the relatively rapid pace and scale of most MPCVD embargoes
    makes per-case NDAs prohibitively difficult.
    As a result, we are intentionally setting aside NDA negotiation as beyond the scope of this proposal.

    On the surface, many bug bounty programs may appear to fall outside our scope because they are often structured as 
    NDAs in which compliance is rewarded.
    For some bounty programs, the penalty for non-compliance or early disclosure is limited to the loss of the reward.
    For others, non-compliance can lead to the forfeiture of a promise of amnesty from the pursuit of civil or criminal
    charges that might otherwise apply because of security or acceptable-use policy violations.
    Nevertheless, we are optimistic that the bulk of this protocol (i.e., the parts that do not interfere with the
    contractual provisions of bounty-associated NDAs) will be found to be compatible with the full variety of 
    bounty-oriented CVD programs existing now and in the future.
