    The [Understanding Vultron](index.md) section assumes that you have:
    
    - an interest in learning about the Vultron Protocol

    see [Implementing Vultron](../howto/index.md).
    For technical reference, see [Reference](../reference/index.md).
    If you're just trying to understand the CVD process, we recommend that you start with the [CERT Guide to Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure](https://vuls.cert.org/confluence/display/CVD/).
