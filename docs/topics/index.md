# Understanding the Vultron Protocol

!!! tip inline end "Prerequisites"

    The [Understanding Vultron](index.md) section assumes that you have:
    
    - an interest in learning about the Vultron Protocol
    - familiarity with the CVD process in general

    If you are already familiar with the Vultron Protocol, and are looking for implementation advice, 
    see [Implementing Vultron](../howto/index.md).
    For technical reference, see [Reference](../reference/index.md).
    If you're just trying to understand the CVD process, we recommend that you start with the [CERT Guide to Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure](https://vuls.cert.org/confluence/display/CVD/).

This section provides an overview of the Vultron Protocol, including:

- [Background](background/index.md)
- [Behavior Logic](behavior_logic/index.md)
- [Formal Protocol overview](formal_protocol/index.md)
- [Future Work](future_work/index.md)
- [Process Models](process_models/index.md)
- [User Stories](user_stories/index.md)
