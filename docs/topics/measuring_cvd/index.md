# Measuring CVD

!!! abstract "Measuring CVD" 

    CVD stands as a consensus response to the persistent fact of vulnerable 
    software, yet few performance indicators have been proposed to measure its 
    efficacy at the broadest scales. In this section, we seek to fill that gap. 
    We begin by deriving a model of all possible CVD histories from first 
    principles, organizing those histories into a partial ordering based on a 
    set of desired criteria. We then compute a baseline expectation for the 
    frequency of each desired criteria and propose a new set of performance 
    indicators to measure the efficacy of CVD practices based on the 
    differentiation of skill and luck in observation data. As a proof of
    concept, we apply these indicators to a variety of longitudinal observations of
    CVD practice and find evidence of significant skill to be prevalent. We 
    conclude with reflections on how this model and its accompanying performance
    indicators could be used by various stakeholders (vendors, system
    owners, coordinators, and governments) to interpret the quality of their
    CVD practices.

(MPCVD)_ by Allen Householder and Jonathan Spring
