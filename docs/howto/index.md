# Implementing Vultron

Here we collect some guidance for potential implementations of Vultron.

While a complete protocol implementation specification remains a work in progress, we do have a few additional 
suggestions for potential implementers.
In this section, we describe an abstract [case object](case_object.md) for use in tracking MPCVD cases.
Next, we touch on the [core MPCVD protocol subprocesses](process_implementation/) (RM, EM, and CS), including how the CS model might integrate with
other processes.
Finally, we provide a few [general notes](general_implementation/) on future implementations.

!!! tip "Vultron is an interoperability protocol"

    The protocol and data structures outlined in this report are intended to facilitate interoperability among individual 
    organizations' workflow management systems.
    As such, they are focused on the exchange of information and data necessary for the MPCVD process to function and will 
    not likely be sufficient to fully address any individual organization's vulnerability response process.


Over time, we plan to expand this section of the documentation to include:

- Basic data model examples
- Behavior logic implementation examples
- Simulation examples
- Communication protocol implementation examples
- Other implementation notes as needed
