# Implementing Vultron

{% include-markdown "../includes/not_normative.md" %}

Here we collect some guidance for potential implementations of Vultron.

While a complete protocol implementation specification remains a work in progress, we do have a few additional
suggestions for potential implementers.

!!! tip inline end "Prerequisites"

    The [Implementing Vultron](index.md) section assumes that you have:
    
    - an interest in implementing the Vultron Protocol
    - basic familiarity with the Vultron Protocol
    - familiarity with the CVD process in general

    If you are unfamiliar with the Vultron Protocol, we recommend that you start with [Understanding Vultron](../topics/index.md).
    For technical reference, see [Reference](../reference/index.md).
    If you're just trying to understand the CVD process, we recommend that you start with the [CERT Guide to Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure](https://vuls.cert.org/confluence/display/CVD/).

In this section, you will find:

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- :material-database: an abstract [case object](case_object.md) for use in tracking MPCVD cases
- :fontawesome-solid-gears: Notes on the [core Vultron Protocol subprocesses](process_implementation.md) (RM, EM, and CS), including how the CS model might integrate with
other processes
- :simple-activitypub: An in-depth exploration of applying the [ActivityPub](activitypub/index.md) protocol as an underlying foundation to
  the Vultron Protocol.
- :material-calendar-month: A few thoughts on the [Embargo Management Process](em_icalendar.md) and how it might be implemented using the `iCalendar` protocol.
- :material-format-list-bulleted: [General notes](general_implementation.md) on future implementations.

</div>

Over time, we plan to expand this section of the documentation to include:

- Basic data model examples
- Behavior logic implementation examples
- Simulation examples
- Communication protocol implementation examples
- Other implementation notes as needed

!!! info "The Vultron Protocol is an interoperability protocol"

    The protocol and data structures outlined in this documentation are intended to facilitate interoperability among individual 
    organizations' workflow management systems.
    As such, they are focused on the exchange of information and data necessary for the MPCVD process to function and will 
    not likely be sufficient to fully address any individual organization's vulnerability response process.
