# Vultron and ActivityPub

The Vultron protocol can be mapped onto the [ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/)
protocol. This mapping is described in the
[Vultron ActivityStreams Ontology](../../reference/ontology/vultron_as.md).

In this section, we'll provide some examples of how the Vultron protocol
message types can be represented as ActivityPub messages using the
[ActivityStreams vocabulary](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/).

## Vultron ActivityStreams

Vultron ActivityStreams (Vultron AS) is an extension of the
[ActivityStreams vocabulary](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/)
to describe the mapping of Vultron to ActivityStreams.

Vultron AS defines a number of new objects and activities that are used in the
Vultron protocol. These are described in the following sections.

We begin with a description of a few [objects](objects.md) that are used in the
Vultron AS vocabulary. Then we describe the [activities](activities/index) that
are used in the Vultron AS vocabulary.
