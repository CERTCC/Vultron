# Process Implementation Notes

{% include-markdown "../includes/not_normative.md" %}

Integrating the Vultron Protocol into everyday MPCVD operations requires each Participant to consider how their business processes
interact with the individual [RM](../topics/process_models/rm/index.md), [EM](../topics/process_models/em/index.md),
and [CS](../topics/process_models/cs/index.md), process models, respectively.
Here we offer some thoughts on where such integration might begin.

## RM Implementation Notes

Roughly speaking, the RM process is very close to a normal [IT Service Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT_service_management) (ITSM)
incident or service request workflow.
As such, the RM process could be implemented as a JIRA ticket workflow, as part of a Kanban process, etc.
The main modifications needed to adapt an existing workflow are to intercept the key milestones and emit the appropriate RM messages:

- when the reports are received (*RK*)

- when the report validation process completes (*RI*, *RV*)

- when the report prioritization process completes (*RA*, *RD*)

- when the report is closed (*RC*)

### Vulnerability Draft Pre-Publication Review

!!! tip inline end "Pre-Publication Drafts in Related Standards"

    [ISO/IEC 29148:2018](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) includes a pre-publication review step in its process.

MPCVD case Participants often share pre-publication drafts of their advisories during the embargo period.
Our protocol proposal is mute on this subject because it is not strictly necessary for the MPCVD process to complete successfully.
However, as we observe in the [ISO Crosswalk](../reference/iso_crosswalks/index.md), the *GI* and *GK* message types appear to provide sufficient mechanics for this
process to be fleshed out as necessary.
This draft-sharing process could be built into the [*prepare publication*](../topics/behavior_logic/publication_bt.md#prepare-publication-behavior) process, where appropriate.

## EM Implementation Notes

### Embargo Management and Calendaring

In terms of the proposal, acceptance, rejection, etc., the EM process is strikingly parallel to the process of
scheduling a meeting in a calendaring system.
In [EM and iCalendar](em_icalendar.md), we suggest a potential mapping of many of the concepts from the EM process
onto [`iCalendar`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar) protocol semantics.

### Embargo Management Does Not Deliver Synchronized Publication

In our protocol design, we were careful to focus the EM process on establishing when publication restrictions are
lifted.
That is not the same as actually scheduling publications following the embargo termination.
Our experience at the CERT/CC shows that this distinction is rarely a significant problem since many case Participants
simply publish at their own pace shortly after the embargo ends.
However, at times, case Participants may find it necessary to coordinate even more closely on publication scheduling.

## CS Implementation Notes

Because part of the CS model is Participant specific and the other is global to the case, we address each part below.

### The *vfd* Process

Similar to the RM process, which is specific to each Participant, the *vfd* process is
individualized to each Vendor (or Deployer, for the simpler $d \xrightarrow{\mathbf{D}} D$ state transition).
Modifications to the Vendor's development process to implement the Vultron Protocol are expected to be minimal and are
limited to the following:

- acknowledging the Vendor's role on report receipt with a *CV* message

- emitting a *CF* message when a fix becomes ready (and possibly terminating any active embargo to open the door to publication)

- (if relevant) issuing a *CD* message when the fix has been deployed

Non-Vendor Deployers are rarely involved in MPCVD cases, but when they are, their main integration point is to emit a
*CD* message when deployment is complete.

### The *pxa* Process

On the other hand, the *pxa* process hinges on monitoring public and private sources for evidence of information leaks,
research publications, and adversarial activity.
In other words, the *pxa* process is well positioned to be wired into Participants' threat intelligence and threat
analysis capabilities.
The goal would be to emit *CP*, *CX*, and *CA* messages as appropriate when such evidence is detected.
Some portions of this process can be automated:

- Human analysts and/or automated search agents can look for evidence of early publication of vulnerability information.

- IDS and IPS signatures might be deployed prior to fix availability to act as an early warning of adversary activity.

- Well-known code publication and malware analysis platforms can be monitored for evidence of exploit publication or use.
