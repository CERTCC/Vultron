!!! warning "Do Not Start Here"

    If this is your first time reading about the Vultron Protocol, we recommend that you start with [Understanding Vultron](../topics/background/index.md).
    This section is heavy on formalism and is intended for readers who are already familiar with the Vultron Protocol
    concepts and design principles.
