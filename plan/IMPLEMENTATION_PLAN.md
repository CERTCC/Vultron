### ❌ Outbox delivery not implemented (lower priority)

`actor_io.py` stub logs placeholder messages (OX-03-001, OX-04-001, OX-04-002).
`core/ports/emitter.py` Protocol stub not yet created (see `notes/architecture-ports-and-adapters.md`
"Dispatch vs Emit Terminology"). Needed before OUTBOX-1 implementation.

### ✅ Triggerable behaviors fully implemented (PRIORITY 30 — COMPLETE)

All 9 trigger endpoints in split router files. P30-1 through P30-6 complete.

### ✅ Hexagonal architecture violations remediated (PRIORITIES 65/75 — ALL COMPLETE)

All P65 and P75 architecture tasks complete. All violations V-01 through V-24
and TECHDEBT-13a–c are fully resolved. `notes/architecture-review.md` is
up to date.

### ✅ Package relocation Phase 1 complete (PRIORITY 60 — COMPLETE)

- `vultron/as_vocab/` → `vultron/wire/as2/vocab/` (P60-1 ✅)
- `vultron/behaviors/` → `vultron/core/behaviors/` (P60-2 ✅)
- `vultron/adapters/` package stub created (P60-3 ✅)

### ✅ DataLayer refactor into ports and adapters (PRIORITY 70 — COMPLETE)

P70-2 through P70-5 all complete. All callers import `DataLayer` from
`vultron.core.ports.datalayer`, `TinyDbDataLayer`/`get_datalayer` from
`vultron.adapters.driven.datalayer_tinydb`, and `Record`/`object_to_record`
from `vultron.adapters.driven.db_record`.

### ✅ Handler and trigger-service logic in core/use_cases/ (PRIORITY 75 — P75-1/2/3 COMPLETE)

All 38 handler use cases and 9 trigger-service use cases now live in
`vultron/core/use_cases/`. The handler adapter layer is reduced to
`handlers/_shim.py`. The dispatcher is modelled as a formal driving port
(`core/ports/dispatcher.py`) backed by `core/dispatcher.py`. The routing
table (`USE_CASE_MAP`) lives in `core/use_cases/use_case_map.py`. Pattern
objects in `extractor.py` use the `Pattern` suffix. P75-4 and P75-5 remain.

### ✅ UseCase interface standardized (P75-4-pre — complete)

`UseCase[Req, Res]` Protocol defined in `vultron/core/ports/use_case.py`.
`UnknownUseCase` in `vultron/core/use_cases/unknown.py` is the reference
implementation; the old callable wrapper delegates to it for backward compat.
P75-4 MUST refactor every use case it touches to the class interface.

### ❌ api/v1 disposition not planned (P75-5)

`vultron/api/v1/` is a vocabulary-examples HTTP adapter (thin routers over
`wire/as2/vocab/examples/`; no business logic). Decision required: keep
as-is, formally deprecate, or remove. Captured as P75-5.

### ❌ Actor independence not implemented (PRIORITY 100)

All actors share a singleton `TinyDbDataLayer` instance. PRIORITY 100 requires
per-actor isolated state. Options documented in `notes/domain-model-separation.md`
(Option B: TinyDB namespace prefix; MongoDB community edition for production).
Blocked by PRIORITY-70 (complete ✅).

### ❌ CaseActor broadcast not implemented (PRIORITY 200)

CM-06-001 requires CaseActor to notify all case participants on case state update.
Blocked by OUTBOX-1.

### ✅ SPEC-COMPLIANCE-3 complete (SC-PRE-2, SC-3.2, SC-3.3 all done)

`SC-PRE-2`, `SC-3.2`, and `SC-3.3` are all complete. The `update_case` guard
checks participant embargo acceptance and logs a WARNING (CM-10-004); full
enforcement deferred to PRIORITY-200.

### ❌ Flaky test not yet fixed (TECHDEBT-15 — new gap)

`test_remove_embargo` in `test/wire/as2/vocab/test_vocab_examples.py:819`
occasionally fails due to py_trees blackboard global state shared across tests.
`specs/testability.md` TB-06-006 mandates all tests be deterministic. Fix:
add `autouse` fixture in `test/wire/as2/vocab/conftest.py` to clear the
blackboard before each test.

### ❌ DRY core domain models (TECHDEBT-16 — new gap)

`vultron/core/models/` domain classes independently repeat common fields
(`id`, `name`, timestamps). Per `notes/domain-model-separation.md` "DRY Core
Domain Models", a `VultronObject` base class should capture these fields;
`VultronEvent` and domain model classes should inherit from it.

### ❌ `docker/README.md` out of date (DOCS-1 — new gap)

`docker/README.md` lists individual per-demo services that no longer exist
in `docker-compose.yml` (now consolidated into a unified `demo` service).
Captured in `notes/codebase-structure.md`. Needs update to describe `api-dev`,
`demo`, `test`, `docs`, and `vultrabot-demo` services.

### ❌ Broken inline code examples in `docs/` (DOCS-2 — new gap)

`docs/reference/code/as_vocab/*.md` reference old `vultron.as_vocab.*` module
paths that moved to `vultron.wire.as2.vocab.*` during P60-1. Running
`mkdocs build` surfaces these errors. Captured in `notes/codebase-structure.md`.

### ❌ Multi-actor demos not yet started (PRIORITY 300)

Blocked by PRIORITY-100 and PRIORITY-200.

---

P75-1, P75-2, P75-2a, P75-2b, P75-2c, P75-3 all complete.
See `plan/IMPLEMENTATION_HISTORY.md` for details.

#### Remaining P75 tasks

- [x] **P75-4-pre**: Standardize use-case interface: `UseCase[Req, Res]` Protocol
  defined in `vultron/core/ports/use_case.py`. `UnknownUseCase` is the reference
  implementation. Old callable wrapper kept for backward compat. **COMPLETE.**

- [ ] **P75-4**: Update driving adapter stubs (`vultron/adapters/driving/cli.py`,
  `vultron/adapters/driving/mcp_server.py`) to call `core/use_cases/` callables
  directly with an injected `DataLayer`, without going through HTTP. Done when
  the CLI and MCP adapters exercise the same code paths as the HTTP inbox adapter.
  **Depends on P75-4-pre, P75-2, P75-3.**

- [ ] **P75-5**: Decide disposition of `vultron/api/v1/`. The v1 API is a
  vocabulary-examples HTTP adapter (thin routers over `wire/as2/vocab/examples/`;
  no business logic). Options: (a) keep as-is with a clear "vocabulary showcase"
  label, (b) merge into `api/v2` as a `/examples/` subrouter, or (c) deprecate
  and remove. Done when a decision is recorded in an ADR or issue and the code
  reflects the decision.

---

### TECHDEBT-15 — Fix flaky `test_remove_embargo` test

**Priority**: High (spec TB-06-006 — all tests MUST be deterministic)

- [ ] **TECHDEBT-15**: Fix `test_remove_embargo` in
  `test/wire/as2/vocab/test_vocab_examples.py:819`. The test fails
  non-deterministically due to py_trees blackboard global state leaking between
  tests. Fix: add an `autouse` fixture in
  `test/wire/as2/vocab/conftest.py` that clears
  `py_trees.blackboard.Blackboard.storage` before and after each test (see
  AGENTS.md "py_trees Blackboard Global State" section). Done when
  `test_remove_embargo` passes reliably in the full test suite across multiple
  runs and no other tests in the file are affected.

---

### TECHDEBT-16 — DRY core domain models (VultronObject base class)

**Priority**: Low (organizational, `notes/domain-model-separation.md`)

- [ ] **TECHDEBT-16**: Add a `VultronObject` base class in `vultron/core/models/`
  capturing common fields shared by all domain objects (e.g., `id`, `name`,
  `created_at`, `updated_at`). Have `VultronEvent` and other domain model classes
  inherit from `VultronObject` rather than directly from `BaseModel`. Mirrors
  the wire-layer class hierarchy at the domain level. Done when the base class
  is defined, all domain model classes inherit from it, repeated field
  definitions are removed, and tests pass.

---

### DOCS-1 — Update `docker/README.md`

**Priority**: Medium (docs correctness, `notes/codebase-structure.md`)

- [ ] **DOCS-1**: Update `docker/README.md` to accurately describe the current
  `docker-compose.yml` services: `api-dev` (API server), `demo` (unified demo
  runner for all demo scripts), `test` (pytest), `docs` (MkDocs), and
  `vultrabot-demo`. Remove references to individual per-demo service containers
  (e.g., `receive-report-demo`, `initialize-case-demo`, etc.) that have been
  consolidated into the `demo` service. Done when the README accurately reflects
  the current services and how to run them.

---

### DOCS-2 — Fix broken inline code examples in `docs/`

**Priority**: Medium (docs correctness, `notes/codebase-structure.md`)

- [ ] **DOCS-2**: Update `docs/reference/code/as_vocab/*.md` files that reference
  old `vultron.as_vocab.*` module paths (moved to `vultron.wire.as2.vocab.*`
  during P60-1). Run `mkdocs build` to surface all broken references, then update
  the affected code blocks and `:::: module.path` autodoc directives to use the
  new paths. Done when `mkdocs build` succeeds without module-not-found errors
  in `docs/reference/code/as_vocab/`.

---

### Phase BT-2.2/2.3 — Optional BT Refactors (low priority)

- [ ] **BT-2.2**: Refactor `close_report` handler to use BT tree
  (reference: `vultron/bt/report_management/_behaviors/close_report.py`)
- [ ] **BT-2.3**: Refactor `invalidate_report` handler to use BT tree
  (reference: `_InvalidateReport` subtree in `validate_report.py`)

---

### Phase OUTBOX-1 — Outbox Local Delivery (lower priority)

**Reference**: `specs/outbox.md` OX-03, OX-04

**Note**: Before OX-1.1, add `vultron/core/ports/emitter.py` — the
`ActivityEmitter` Protocol that driven delivery adapters implement.
Per `notes/architecture-ports-and-adapters.md` "Dispatch vs Emit Terminology",
this is the outbound counterpart to `core/ports/dispatcher.py`.

- [ ] **OX-1.0**: Add `vultron/core/ports/emitter.py` — `ActivityEmitter`
  Protocol stub (outbound counterpart to `core/ports/dispatcher.py`). Done when
  the Protocol is defined with at least an `emit(activity, recipients)` method
  and `adapters/driven/delivery_queue.py` references it as the port interface.
- [ ] **OX-1.1**: Implement local delivery: write activity from actor outbox to
  recipient actor's inbox in DataLayer (OX-04-001, OX-04-002). **Depends on OX-1.0.**
- [ ] **OX-1.2**: Integrate delivery as background task after handler completion
  (OX-03-002, OX-03-003); must not block HTTP response
- [ ] **OX-1.3**: Add idempotency check — delivering same activity twice MUST NOT
  create duplicate inbox entries (OX-06-001)
- [ ] **OX-1.4**: Add `test/api/v2/backend/test_outbox.py`

---

### PRIORITY-70 Complete ✅ — DataLayer in Ports and Adapters

P70-2 through P70-5 all complete. See `plan/IMPLEMENTATION_HISTORY.md`.

---

### PRIORITY-75 Complete (P75-1/2/3/4-pre) ✅ — Business Logic in core/use_cases/

P75-1, P75-2, P75-2a, P75-2b, P75-2c, P75-3, P75-4-pre all complete.
See `plan/IMPLEMENTATION_HISTORY.md` for details. Remaining tasks:

- [x] **P75-4-pre**: Standardize use-case interface (**COMPLETE**)
- [ ] **P75-4**: Update driving adapter stubs (see above; **depends on P75-4-pre**)
- [ ] **P75-5**: Decide disposition of `vultron/api/v1/` (see above)

---

### Phase PRIORITY-100 — Actor Independence (PRIORITY 100)

**Reference**: `plan/PRIORITIES.md` PRIORITY 100,
`specs/case-management.md` CM-01,
`notes/domain-model-separation.md` (Per-Actor DataLayer Isolation Options)

**Blocked by**: PRIORITY-70 (complete ✅)

- [ ] **ACT-1**: Draft ADR for per-actor DataLayer isolation — document options
  (Option B: TinyDB namespace prefix; MongoDB community for production),
  trade-offs, and migration path. The MongoDB approach is recommended for
  production-grade isolation; implement Option B first as an incremental step.

- [ ] **ACT-2**: Implement per-actor DataLayer isolation per chosen design. Done
  when Actor A's DataLayer operations do not affect Actor B's state and tests
  confirm isolation.

- [ ] **ACT-3**: Update `get_datalayer` dependency and all handler tests to use
  per-actor DataLayer fixtures.

---

### Phase PRIORITY-200 — CaseActor Broadcast (PRIORITY 200)

**Blocked by**: OUTBOX-1

**Reference**: `specs/case-management.md` CM-06, `plan/PRIORITIES.md` PRIORITY 200

- [ ] **CA-1**: After OUTBOX-1, implement CaseActor broadcast in `update_case`
  handler — send ActivityStreams activity to each active `CaseParticipant`'s
  inbox (CM-06-001, CM-06-002).
- [ ] **CA-2**: Add `GET /actors/{case_actor_id}/action-rules` endpoint returning
  valid CVD actions for a named participant given current RM/EM/CS/VFD state
  (CM-07-001, AR-07-001, AR-07-002). Add tests.
- [ ] **CA-3**: Add tests verifying CaseActor notifies all participants on case
  state update.

---

### Phase PRIORITY-300 — Multi-Actor Demos (PRIORITY 300)

**Blocked by**: PRIORITY-100, PRIORITY-200

**Reference**: `plan/PRIORITIES.md` PRIORITY 300, `notes/demo-future-ideas.md`

- [ ] **D5-1**: Confirm PRIORITY-100 and PRIORITY-200 are complete; update design.
- [ ] **D5-2**: Demo Scenario 1 (finder + vendor): Dockerized with two actor
  containers + CaseActor container.
- [ ] **D5-3**: Demo Scenario 2 (finder + vendor + coordinator).
- [ ] **D5-4**: Demo Scenario 3 (ownership transfer + multi-vendor).
- [ ] **D5-5**: Integration tests and Docker Compose configs for each scenario.
