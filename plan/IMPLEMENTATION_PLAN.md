# Vultron API v2 Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan tracks forward-looking work against `specs/*` and
`plan/PRIORITIES.md`. Contains only pending, in-progress, and blocked tasks.

**Completed tasks**: see `plan/IMPLEMENTATION_HISTORY.md` (append-only archive).

**Priority ordering note:** `plan/PRIORITIES.md` is authoritative for project
priority. Section order here groups related work by execution context and MUST
NOT override `plan/PRIORITIES.md` when the two differ.

## PRIORITY-350 — Maintenance and Tooling

**Reference**: `plan/PRIORITIES.md` PRIORITY 350

- [ ] **DOCS-3**: Update `notes/user-stories-trace.md` (the traceability
  matrix) to map every user story in `docs/topics/user_stories` to the
  exact implementing requirements in `specs/`. Add a mapping for each story
  and mark stories lacking requirement coverage. Add a new section in
  `plan/IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md` listing stories with insufficient coverage.

## Deferred (Per PRIORITIES.md)

- USE-CASE-01 **`CloseCaseUseCase` wire-type construction** — Replace direct
  construction of `VultronActivity(as_type="Leave")` with domain event
  emission through the `ActivityEmitter` port. Defer until outbound delivery
  integration beyond OX-1.0 is implemented.
- USE-CASE-02 **UseCase Protocol generic enforcement** — Decide on a consistent
  `UseCaseResult` Pydantic return envelope; enforce via mypy. Defer to after
  TECHDEBT-21/22.
- **EP-02/EP-03** — EmbargoPolicy API + compatibility evaluation (`PROD_ONLY`)
- **AR-04/AR-05/AR-06** — Job tracking, pagination, bulk ops (`PROD_ONLY`)
- AGENTIC-00 **Agentic AI integration** (Priority 1000) — out of scope until
  protocol foundation is stable
- FUZZ-00 **Fuzzer node re-implementation** (Priority 500) — see
  `notes/bt-fuzzer-nodes.md`
- IDEA-260402-02 **Per-participant case replica management** — Each Participant
  Actor maintains their own copy of the case object, synchronised from the
  CaseActor via `Announce(CaseLogEntry)` replication. SYNC-1 through SYNC-4
  implement the CaseActor side; the participant-side case replica handler
  (routing inbound `Announce` to the correct local case copy) is part of
  SYNC-2 scope. See `plan/IDEAS.md` IDEA-260402-02 and
  `notes/sync-log-replication.md` for the design.
