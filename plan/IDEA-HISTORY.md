## IDEA-260402-01 Config files should be YAML and loaded into a structured config object

relevant on or after commit: 3fdbfa96155d87d716027c5d3a1fb929d0968b28

When we have a need for config files, we should use YAML for readability and
ease of editing. We should also load the YAML config into a structured
config object using Pydantic so that we can enforce types and have a clear
schema for our configuration. Rough sketch of the workflow: Load YAML config
into a dict (`config_dict=yaml.safe_load()`), then pass that dict to a Pydantic
model (`Config.model_validate(config_dict)`) that defines the schema for our
configuration. This can also allow us to have nested configuration sections
for different components, and modularity in how we define and validate
config for different adapters or features.

`specs/configuration.md` (CFG-01 through CFG-06) and
`notes/configuration.md`.
