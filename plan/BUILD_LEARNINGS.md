## Implementation Notes

Longer-term notes can be found in `/notes/*.md`. This file is ephemeral
and will be reset periodically, so it's meant to capture more immediate
insights, issues, and learnings during the implementation process.

### 2026-06-08 ISSUE-757 — Shared participant lookup must support both case participant surfaces

- `VulnerabilityCase` fixtures and call sites are mixed: some populate
  `case_participants`, others rely on `actor_participant_index`.
- A shared BT lookup node that only scans `case_participants` regresses
  status workflows that previously used `actor_participant_index` checks.
- The reusable participant-finder logic should seed from the
  `actor_participant_index` direct hit first, then scan `case_participants`.
