## Implementation Notes

Longer-term notes can be found in `/notes/*.md`. This file is ephemeral
and will be reset periodically, so it's meant to capture more immediate
insights, issues, and learnings during the implementation process.

### 2026-06-11 OUTBOX-873-TEST-COVERAGE — make acceptance criteria explicit in one file

Issue #873 found that most delivery-path coverage already existed but was split
across sections/files. Adding explicit tests in
`test/adapters/driving/fastapi/test_outbox.py` for direct `to` extraction and
malformed bare-string `object_` integrity checks keeps OX-08/OX-09 validation
discoverable in the canonical outbox test module and reduces ambiguity during
future outbox refactors.

### 2026-06-11 NODES-SPLIT — VulnerabilityCase.case_statuses has a default initial CaseStatus

`VulnerabilityCase.case_statuses` is auto-populated with one `CaseStatus`
(em_state=EM.NONE, UUID id) when the object is created. Tests that check
`len(case.case_statuses) == 1` after a single append will fail with `2`.
Use `initial_count + 1` pattern or check only SUCCESS status.
