## 2026-03-09 — Hexagonal architecture refactor elevated to PRIORITY 50 (immediate next)

Per updated `plan/PRIORITIES.md`, the hexagonal architecture refactor with `triggers.py`
as the starting point is now the top priority. The plan has been updated accordingly:
`Phase ARCH-1` is renamed to `Phase PRIORITY-50` and moved to be the immediate next
phase after PRIORITY-30 (now complete). The old "PRIORITY 150" label in the plan was
incorrect; PRIORITIES.md has always listed this as Priority 50.

### Approach for P50-0: Extract service layer from `triggers.py`

`triggers.py` is 1274 lines with all nine trigger endpoint functions each containing
inline domain logic (data lookups, state transitions, activity construction, outbox
updates). The fix is a two-step operation within one agent cycle:

**Step 1 — Create `vultron/api/v2/backend/trigger_services/` package**:
- `report.py` — service functions for `validate_report`, `invalidate_report`,
  `reject_report`, `close_report`
- `case.py` — service functions for `engage_case`, `defer_case`
- `embargo.py` — service functions for `propose_embargo`, `evaluate_embargo`,
  `terminate_embargo`

Each service function signature should be:
```python
def svc_validate_report(actor_id: str, offer_id: str, note: str | None, dl: DataLayer) -> dict:
    ...
```
The `DataLayer` is passed in from the router (via `Depends(get_datalayer)`), not
fetched inside the service. This aligns with R-05 (DI via ports) even before the
full ARCH-1.4 restructure.

**Step 2 — Thin-ify and split the router**:
- Split `triggers.py` into `trigger_report.py`, `trigger_case.py`,
  `trigger_embargo.py` in `vultron/api/v2/routers/`
- Each router function becomes: validate request → call service → return response
- No domain logic in routers

**Additional cleanup**:
- Consolidate `ValidateReportRequest` and `InvalidateReportRequest` (they are
  structurally identical — CS-09-002). Use a shared base `ReportTriggerRequest`
  with subclasses if needed.
- Trigger tests should be split to match the new file structure and include
  service-layer unit tests independent of HTTP.

### Why start with `triggers.py` before ARCH-1.1?

ARCH-1.1 through ARCH-1.4 are deep structural changes affecting many files across
the codebase. P50-0 (triggers.py service extraction) is scoped to a single large
file, delivers immediate architectural value (no domain logic in routers), and does
not require the broader `core/`/`wire/`/`adapters/` directory restructure to be
in place first. It also establishes the pattern that ARCH-1.1 through 1.4 will
generalize to the rest of the codebase.

ARCH-1.1 and ARCH-1.2 remain prerequisites for ARCH-1.3 and ARCH-1.4 as documented
in `notes/architecture-review.md`.

---



`specs/architecture.md` and `notes/architecture-review.md` were added since the
last plan refresh. The review identifies 11 violations (V-01 to V-11) and a
remediation plan (R-01 to R-06). The most impactful violations are:

- **V-01**: `MessageSemantics` mixed with AS2 structural enums in `vultron/enums.py`
- **V-02**: `DispatchActivity.payload: as_Activity` (AS2 type leaks into core)
- **V-04**: `verify_semantics` decorator re-invokes `find_matching_semantics`
  (second AS2-to-domain mapping point, violates Rule 4)

Phase ARCH-1 now tracks this work. ARCH-1.1 (R-01) must be done before ARCH-1.2
(R-02), which must precede ARCH-1.3 (R-03/R-04).

## 2026-03-09 — P30-4 `close-report` vs `reject-report` distinction

Both `reject-report` and `close-report` emit `RmCloseReport` (`as_Reject`), but
they differ in context:

- `reject-report` hard-rejects an incoming report offer (offer not yet validated;
  `object=offer.as_id`)
- `close-report` closes a report after the RM lifecycle has proceeded (RM → C
  transition; emits RC message)

The existing `trigger_reject_report` implementation uses `offer_id` as its target.
The `trigger_close_report` implementation should also use `offer_id` but should
validate that the offer's report is in an appropriate RM state for closure (not
just any offered report). This distinction should be documented in the endpoint
docstring.

## 2026-03-09 — CS-09-002 duplication in triggers.py request models

`ValidateReportRequest` and `InvalidateReportRequest` in `triggers.py` are
structurally identical (both have `offer_id: str` and `note: str | None`). Per
CS-09-002, these should be consolidated into a single base model with the other
as a subclass or alias. Low-priority but worth addressing when the file is next
modified.

---

## 2026-03-09 — P30-4 complete: close-report trigger endpoint

`POST /actors/{actor_id}/trigger/close-report` added. Emits `RmCloseReport`
(RM → C transition), updates offer/report status and actor outbox, returns
HTTP 409 if already CLOSED. 9 unit tests added.

Also converted `RM` from plain `Enum` to `StrEnum` for consistency with `EM`.
This changes `str(RM.X)` from `"RM.REPORT_MANAGEMENT_X"` to `"X"`, resulting
in cleaner BT node names (e.g., `q_rm_in_CLOSED` instead of
`q_rm_in_RM.REPORT_MANAGEMENT_CLOSED`). Updated `test_conditions.py` to check
`state.value` in node name instead of `state.name`.

## Triggerable behaviors should start to live in `vultron/core/` and respect the architecture

The `triggers.py` module currently has a mix of architectural violations, including
including directly invoking domain logic in the routers. We should start 
separating these concerns as soon as practical in preparation for the 
architecture refactor. It would be better to start moving towards the 
cleaner architecture where we can now than to continue building out more 
things that will have to be refactored later. We know the direction we are 
going with the architecture, so we should start moving in that direction now 
when we can.

This idea generalizes too. When you're modifying or adding new router code, 
consider the architectural intent and whether the code you're writing 
respects the intended separation of concerns. Try to avoid mixing domain 
logic directly into the routers, and instead think about how to structure the
code so that the ports and adapters model is cleaner even before the full 
refactor.

Fix what you can as you go, and add items you observe as technical debt to 
the implementation notes for anything you notice but can't fix immediately.

Technical debt: Refactor triggers.py to respect the hexagonal architecture 
concepts.

## Consider use of `transitions` module for state machines

Although we have manually enumerated state machine states for EM, RM, and CS,
we don't really have a clean implementation of the state machines themselves.
We should consider integrating the `transitions` module to make it easier to 
define and maintain the state machines. This is not a high priority right 
now, but if we find an opportunity to integrate it cleanly (especially if it 
would help solve a problem down the road) we should consider doing so.

## 2026-03-09 — P30-6 complete: trigger sub-command in vultron-demo CLI

Added `vultron-demo trigger` sub-command backed by `vultron/demo/trigger_demo.py`.

Two end-to-end demo workflows are implemented:
- **Demo 1 (validate and engage)**: finder submits report via inbox → vendor
  calls `POST .../trigger/validate-report` → vendor calls
  `POST .../trigger/engage-case`.
- **Demo 2 (invalidate and close)**: finder submits report via inbox → vendor
  calls `POST .../trigger/invalidate-report` → vendor calls
  `POST .../trigger/close-report`.

Supporting changes:
- Added `post_to_trigger()` helper to `vultron/demo/utils.py`.
- Added `trigger` demo to `DEMOS` list in `vultron/demo/cli.py`; it now runs
  as part of `vultron-demo all`.
- Updated `docs/reference/code/demo/demos.md` and `cli.md` with new entries.

Phase PRIORITY-30 is now fully complete (P30-1 through P30-6).
