# Implementation Notes

Longer-term notes can be found in `/notes/*.md`. This file is ephemeral
and will be reset periodically, so it's meant to capture more immediate 
insights, issues, and learnings during the implementation process.

Previous agents are reporting that the IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md is too large 
to read at once. Is there a way to break it into smaller pieces? For example,
keep the IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md as a forward-looking plan and move the detailed
prior tasks and their status to a separate file that can be archived as needed?
E.g., "IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md" or "IMPLEMENTATION_HISTORY.md" that would 
become an append-only file? Document choices into specs/project-documentation.md
and AGENTS.md files as appropriate.
