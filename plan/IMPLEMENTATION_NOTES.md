# Implementation Notes

Longer-term notes can be found in `/notes/*.md`. This file is ephemeral
and will be reset periodically, so it's meant to capture more immediate
insights, issues, and learnings during the implementation process.

## Outbox Delivery Gap

`vultron/api/v2/data/actor_io.py` has a placeholder that appends strings to an
outbox list but does not write to any recipient actor's inbox. No delivery
mechanism exists. This means outbox-based activities (e.g., CreateCase
activity generated by `create_case` handler) are never actually received by
other actors. This is acceptable for the prototype demos (which sequence
activities manually) but must be resolved before the `CaseActor` broadcast
model (Priority 200) can work correctly.

## CM-03-006 Rename Risk

`VulnerabilityCase.case_status` (list field with singular name) is referenced
throughout `handlers.py` (~20 call sites), `behaviors/`, and many tests.
The rename to `case_statuses` is a correctness improvement per the spec but
carries significant breakage risk. Run `grep -rn "\.case_status" vultron/ test/`
before starting to quantify scope. Consider doing `case_statuses` and
`participant_statuses` renames in the same PR to keep the diff localized.

## Demo Script Gap Summary

Per `plan/PRIORITIES.md`, the following howto workflows still need demo scripts:

- **Higher priority**: `manage_embargo.md`, `manage_participants.md`
- **Lower priority**: `error.md`
