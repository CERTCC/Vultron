# Priorities

The top priority is the Behavior Tree prototype implementation outlined in
`specs/behavior-tree-integration.md` and `plan/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.
Phase BT-1 is complete; the next priority is Phase BT-2 (extend BT integration
to remaining report handlers). See `plan/IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md` for design
decisions and rationale.

Features that primarily serve to improve production-readiness are lower priority
than any of the above.
