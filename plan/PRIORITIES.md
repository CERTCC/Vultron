# Priorities

The top priority is the Behavior Tree prototype implementation outlined in 
`plan/BT_INTEGRATION.md`. This is the critical path for the project and will 
enable us to test and iterate on the core architecture. Incorporating this
plan into the relevant specifications is the next step.

Features that primarily serve to improve production-readiness are lower priority
than any of the above.
