# Bugs to fix

Items in this file supersede IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md.

Many of the demo scripts in `vultron/scripts` do not have tested dockerized
implementations. This is a problem because it means that the demos are not yet
self-contained and cannot be run by users without additional setup. See 
`plan/PRIORITIES.md` for more details on the importance of dockerizing the demos.
