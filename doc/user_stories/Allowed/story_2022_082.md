# User Story `2022_082` #

As a non-vendor Participant I want to be informed of CVD in order to perform activities like risk assessment, mitigation, verify mitigation, not be surprised, prepare messaging, etc.

## Notes ##

*(as of v0.4.0)*
The protocol does not dictate who gets to be a case Participant. That needs to be decided on a per-case, per-Participant level.
