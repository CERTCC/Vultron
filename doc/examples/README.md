# Vultron Activity Vocabulary Examples

The json files in this directory are intended to serve as examples of how the Vultron Activity Vocabulary can be used to
describe the activities that are part of the Vultron protocol.

As of April 2023, these examples are meant to serve as the basis for conversations with the community about the
Vultron protocol.  They are not intended to be a complete specification of the protocol. We will be adding more examples
and code to this repository as we continue to develop the protocol.
