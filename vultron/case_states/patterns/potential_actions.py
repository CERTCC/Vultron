This module contains the logic for determining the potential actions that can be taken
based on the current state of the CVD case.

The logic is based on the CVD state model, which is a 6-character string that represents
the current state of the CVD case. The characters in the string represent the following
states:
v,V - Vendor Awareness
f,F - Fix Availability
d,D - Fix Deployment
p,P - Public Awareness
x,X - Exploit Public
a,A - Attacks Observed
