Custom Activity Streams Activities for VulnerabilityCase objects.
Each activity should have a VulnerabilityCase object as either its target or object.

The activity classes are private to the wire layer and live in submodules
grouped by concern; importing this package imports every submodule, so each
class registers its vocabulary entry.
