    The fundamental model for links is established by [RFC5988].
    Many of the properties defined by the Activity Vocabulary allow values that are either instances of Object or a Link.
    When a Link is used, it establishes a qualified relation connecting the subject to the resource identified by the href property.
    Properties of the Link are properties of the reference as opposed to properties of the resource.
    Links are disjoint from the Object type.
