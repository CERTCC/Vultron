    """https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-activity
    An Activity is a subtype of Object that describes some form of action that may happen, is
    currently happening, or has already happened. The Activity type itself serves as an abstract
    base type for all types of activities. It is important to note that an Activity is not a
    representation of a currently executing process, but rather a statement about that process.
    For example, a person walking down the street is not an Activity unless they are posting a
    picture of themselves walking down the street. The Activity in that case would be the posting
    of the picture, not the person walking down the street.
