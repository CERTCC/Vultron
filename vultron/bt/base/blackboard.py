"""
This module defines Blackboard class for sharing data between nodes in the tree.

The default Blackboard class is a dict, which is good enough if you just want
to run a single tree in a single process.

If you want multiple trees in a single process with shared state, just use
the same Blackboard object instance for each tree.

If you want to run multiple trees in a single process without shared state,
you'll need to use a different Blackboard object instance for each tree.
You can still do that with the default Blackboard class, but you'll need to
create a new Blackboard object instance for each tree.

If you want to run multiple trees in multiple processes with shared state,
you'll need to use a Blackboard object that can communicate with some external
data store, such as a key-value store on a server. The default Blackboard
class is not designed for that use case, but you can subclass it to use
any object that implements the `__getitem__` and `__setitem__` methods
to provide a python dict-like interface.
For example, mongodict and redis-dict provide such an interface for MongoDb and Redis,
respectively.
