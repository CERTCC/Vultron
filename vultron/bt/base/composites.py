    ParallelNode is a composite node that ticks its children in parallel.

    When subclassing, you must set the `m` attribute indicating the minimum number of successes.
    The maximum failures is then calculated as `N - m`, where N is the number of children.

    - When a child returns SUCCESS, the ParallelNode increments a success counter.
    - When a child returns FAILURE, the ParallelNode increments a failure counter.
    - If the success counter reaches the minimum number of successes, the ParallelNode returns SUCCESS.
    - If the failure counter reaches the maximum number of failures, the ParallelNode returns FAILURE.
    - If neither of the above conditions are met, the ParallelNode returns RUNNING.

    !!! warning "Not Fully Implemented"

        In the current implementation, the ParallelNode does not actually tick its children in parallel.
        Instead, it ticks them in a random order and counts the results until either SUCCESS or FAILURE is
        indicated as above. This is good enough for demonstration purposes, but it should be replaced with
        a proper parallel implementation.
