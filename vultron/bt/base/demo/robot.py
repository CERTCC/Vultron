"""
This module demonstrates a simple robot behavior tree.
The robot has a number of tasks it must perform in order to complete its mission.
The robot must find a ball, approach the ball, grasp the ball, approach the bin, and place
the ball in the bin. If any of these tasks fail, the robot must ask for help.

Oh, and the first time the robot picks up the ball, we knock it out of the robot's grasp, because
we're mean like that.

The implementation also shows how to use the included bt tree fuzzer to exercise the bt tree.
