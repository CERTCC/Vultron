Each of the following classes is a fuzzable bt tree node.
The fuzzing is done by the bt.fuzzer module.
These classes are the most likely places where one of the following is likely to apply:
1. a human might need to intervene to make a decision
2. a human might need to intervene to provide input to an automated decision process
3. an automated decision process might need to be implemented based on some site-specific logic

But for now they are just stubs that return a random result so we can exercise the tree.
