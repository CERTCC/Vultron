1. Study specs/*.md (hint: start with specs/README.md) to learn the application specifications.
2. Study plan/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md to understand the current progress and 
   remaining tasks
3. study plan/IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md to understand the current progress notes
5. Pick the most important unchecked task.
4. As needed, study notes/*.md for any relevant lessons learned (hint: start with notes/README.md).
6. Search the codebase before making changes ("don't assume not implemented").
7. Implement the task and run the validation commands found in AGENTS.md.
8. If tests pass
   1. update plans/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (mark task done),
   2. update plans/IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md with any relevant notes about the implementation
   3. git add -A,
