 1. study @specs to understand the current specifications.
 2. Study @plan/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md and @plan/IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md to understand current progress.
 3. Study @plan/BT_INTEGRATION.md to understand the intent of the next phase of the project.
 4. Study @docs/topics/behavior_logic to understand the early design intent of the earlier
 behavior tree simulator implementation.
 5. Study @vultron/ to understand the current codebase. 
    1. @vultron/bt and @vultron/api will be of particular relevance.
    2. @vultron/behavior contains the latest behavior tree implementation, 
       but it is still in early stages and will be the target of future BT integration work.
 6. Ensure all insights from @plan/BT_INTEGRATION.md are capture in the 
    appropriate specs or IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md files.
 7. Remove BT_INTEGRATION.md once all insights have been distributed to the appropriate files.
 8. git commit the refined specifications with a clear commit message.

DO NOT BEGIN IMPLEMENTATION.
This task is ONLY to update markdown files to refine the plan.
