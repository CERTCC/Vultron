 1. study @specs to understand the current specifications.
 2. Study @plan/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md and @plan/IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md to understand current progress.
 3. Study @plan/BT_INTEGRATION.md to understand the intent of the next phase of the project.
 4. Study @docs/topics/behavior_logic to understand the early design intent of the earlier
 behavior tree simulator implementation.
 5. Study @vultron/ to understand the current codebase. 
    1. @vultron/bt and @vultron/api will be of particular relevance.
 6. Refine @plan/BT_INTEGRATION.md based on your understanding of the project. 

DO NOT BEGIN IMPLEMENTATION.
This task is ONLY to update @plan/BT_INTEGRATION.md to refine the plan. 
We will be integrating this into requirement specifications later, but you're only updating the one file for now.
