1. Study specs/* to learn the application specifications.
2. Study plan/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md to understand the current progress.
3. Study plan/IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md to understand any additional insights or observations that may be helpful for implementation.
4. Study vultron/* to understand the codebase.
5. Study **/AGENTS.md to understand additional advice and guidance for 
   implementation.
6. Update **/AGENTS.md with any new insights or recommendations based on your 
   design review.
7. If any given AGENTS.md file has become too long or unwieldy, consider 
   breaking it into multiple files that can be placed in individual directories
   corresponding to the relevant topics of concern. For example, if there are
   many insights related to the design of the system, those could be moved to
   a /specs/AGENTS.md file.
8. Insights that do not belong in an AGENTS.md can be placed into an 
   appropriate notes/*.md file. Notes files are intended to be retained 
   indefinitely, unlike plan/IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md which is meant to be 
   ephemeral and reset periodically.
9. DO NOT IMPLEMENT ANYTHING YET. This is a design review to provide guidance to future agents.
10. git commit the refined AGENTS.md file(s) with a clear commit message
