1. Study plans/PRIORITIES.md to understand the current priorities for the project
2. Study specs/* to learn the application specifications.
3. Study plans/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md to understand the current progress.
4. Study notes/*.md to understand lessons learned and insights from previous
   implementation and design efforts.
5. Study vultron/* to understand the codebase.
6. Study test/* to understand existing tests.
7. Refine specs/* to separate topics of concern into distinct files.
   1. Incorporate new insights from your review of the specifications,
      implementation plan, and notes into refined specifications.
   2. Avoid over-specifying implementation details in the specifications; focus on
      what needs to be achieved rather than how it should be achieved.
   3. Follow existing formatting and style conventions in the specs/ directory.
   4. Individual requirements should be atomic, verifiable, and succinct.
   5. Use the PROD_ONLY tag to indicate any requirements that are only relevant
      for production and not for prototype development or testing.
   6. Remove redundant requirements that appear in multiple files.
8. Update specs/README.md to reflect the actual set of specification files.
9. git commit the refined specifications with a clear commit message
