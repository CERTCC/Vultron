1. Study specs/* to learn the application specifications. 
2. Study IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md to understand the current progress.
3. Study src/* to understand shared utilities.
4. Use search tools to compare existing source code against specs/*. Ultrathink to perform a gap analysis.
5. Update IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md with a bulleted list of prioritized tasks.
6. git commit changes with a clear commit message.

IMPORTANT: Plan only. 
Do NOT implement anything. 
Do NOT assume functionality is missing; confirm with code search first.
