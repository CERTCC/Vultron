1. Study specs/* to learn the application specifications.
2. Study plan/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md to understand the current progress.
3. Study vultron/* to understand the codebase.
4. Study plan/PRIORITIES.md to understand the current priorities for implementation.
5. Study test/* to understand existing tests.
6. Use search tools to compare existing source code against specs/*. Ultrathink to perform a gap analysis.
7. Update plan/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md with a bulleted list of prioritized tasks.
    - Use markdown tasks (e.g. `- [ ] Task description`) to track progress.
    - Each item in IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md should be atomic, actionable, and clearly defined.
8. Update plan/IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md with any additional insights, questions, or observations that may be helpful for future agents working on implementation.
9. git commit changes with a clear commit message.

IMPORTANT: Write plan files only.
Do NOT implement any code.
Do NOT assume functionality is missing; confirm with code search first.
