  Process a single open GitHub Concern-type issue into a concrete action plan:
  runs a grill-me interview to understand root cause, options, and fix scope,
  then creates one or more GitHub implementation issues and optionally updates
  specs/ or notes/ when the concern reveals missing documentation. Archives the
  concern via the `archive-history` skill, comments resolution links on
  the concern issue, and closes it. Opens a docs-only PR (specs-notes label)
  only when specs/notes/AGENTS.md files are changed. Use when the user says
  "ingest concern", references an open Concern-type GitHub issue number, or
  wants to convert a tracked concern into an implementation plan with tickets.

# Skill: Ingest Concern

Convert a single open GitHub `type:Concern` issue into a concrete action plan.
Interview → explore → create impl issues → optionally update docs → archive +
close the concern.

## Constants

```text
REPO           = CERTCC/Vultron
REPO_NODE_ID   = R_kgDOIn77fA
CONCERN_TYPE   = IT_kwDOAjf0s84B_2VT
```

---

## Workflow

### Phase 0 — Select the Concern

If the user provided a GitHub issue number (e.g., `#42` or just `42`),
skip to Phase 1.

Otherwise, query open Concern-type issues and present them as a
multiple-choice list via `ask_user`:

```bash
gh issue list \
  --repo CERTCC/Vultron \
  --state open \
  --limit 200 \
  --json number,title,issueType \
  --jq '.[] | select(.issueType.name == "Concern") | "#\(.number): \(.title)"'
```

Build a `choices` array from the results and wait for the user's selection.

### Phase 1 — Read and Validate the Concern

Fetch the full issue and validate it is an open Concern before proceeding:

```bash
ISSUE_JSON=$(gh issue view "${CONCERN_NUMBER}" \
  --repo CERTCC/Vultron \
  --json number,title,body,labels,state,issueType)

ISSUE_STATE=$(echo "${ISSUE_JSON}" | jq -r '.state')
ISSUE_TYPE=$(echo "${ISSUE_JSON}"  | jq -r '.issueType.name // ""')

if [ "${ISSUE_STATE}" != "OPEN" ] || [ "${ISSUE_TYPE}" != "Concern" ]; then
  echo "Error: #${CONCERN_NUMBER} is not an open Concern issue \
(state=${ISSUE_STATE}, type=${ISSUE_TYPE}). Stopping."
  exit 1
fi
```

Stop here (do not proceed to Phase 2) if validation fails. Report the actual
state and type to the user so they can correct the issue number.

Use the title and body from `${ISSUE_JSON}` as source material for all
subsequent steps.

### Phase 2 — Study Context

Invoke the `study-project-docs` skill. It loads all specs, reads `plan/`,
`docs/adr/`, `notes/`, `AGENTS.md`, and `docs/reference/codebase/`.

Explore the codebase files referenced in the concern's **Evidence** section.
Answer questions from exploration rather than asking the user where possible.

### Phase 3 — Grill-Me Exploration

Invoke the `grill-me` skill. Resolve every decision branch one at a time via
`ask_user`, providing a recommendation for each. Cover:

1. **Root cause** — What is actually broken, risky, or missing? Is the concern
   accurately scoped?
2. **Impact** — If left unaddressed, what fails or degrades?
3. **Options** — What are 2–3 ways to address this concern?
4. **Recommended approach** — Which option do we go with, and why?
5. **Acceptance criteria** — How do we verify the concern is fully resolved?
   (Drive one GitHub issue per distinct AC cluster.)
6. **Spec / notes gaps** — Does this concern reveal a missing requirement in
   `specs/` or a missing design decision in `notes/`? If so, which file and
   what should be added or changed?
7. **AGENTS.md gap** — Is there a recurring implementation pitfall that agents
   need to know about? If so, what's the canonical pitfall text?

Do **not** write anything until grill-me is complete.

### Phase 3b — Create Task Branch (if docs changes are expected)

If Phase 3 established a concrete spec, notes, or `AGENTS.md` gap (i.e.,
Phase 4 will produce file writes), create the task branch **now** — before
writing any files — so uncommitted changes are never at risk of being
clobbered by `git reset --hard`:

```bash
SCRIPT="$HOME/.copilot/skills/manage-worktree/scripts/manage_worktree.sh"
if [ -f "$SCRIPT" ]; then
  bash "$SCRIPT" ensure-synced || { echo "❌ Aborted — sync check failed." >&2; exit 1; }
else
  git fetch origin --quiet 2>/dev/null || true
  BEHIND=$(git rev-list --count HEAD..origin/main 2>/dev/null || echo 0)
  [ "$BEHIND" -gt 0 ] && { echo "❌ Aborted: $BEHIND commit(s) behind origin/main. Run: git rebase origin/main" >&2; exit 1; }
fi
git switch -c ingest/concern-${CONCERN_NUMBER}-<slug>
```

If Phase 3 found no doc gaps (Phase 4 will be skipped entirely), skip
this step. The branch is only needed when there are files to commit.

### Phase 4 — Update Specs / Notes (optional)

Only proceed if Phase 3 established a concrete spec or notes gap.

- **`specs/<topic>.yaml`** — Add or amend requirements that the concern
  reveals are missing. Follow `specs/meta-specifications.yaml` conventions
  (ID scheme `PREFIX-NN-NNN`, RFC 2119 keywords, YAML structure).
  Update `specs/README.md` if a new file is added.
- **`notes/<topic>.md`** — Add a design decision or pitfall entry derived
  from the concern. Every `notes/*.md` must have valid YAML frontmatter
  (`title`, `status`). Update `notes/README.md` if a new file is added.
- **`AGENTS.md`** — Append a new pitfall entry in the
  **Common Pitfalls (Lessons Learned)** section if Phase 3 identified a
  recurring agent guidance gap.

Skip this phase entirely if grill-me did not surface a documentation gap.

After completing any file writes, record the created filenames for use in
later phases:

```bash
SPEC_FILE="<topic>.yaml"    # e.g., "actor-discovery.yaml"; leave empty if no spec created
NOTES_FILE="<topic>.md"     # e.g., "actor-discovery.md"; leave empty if no notes created
```

### Phase 5 — Create Implementation Issues

Create one GitHub issue per distinct cluster of acceptance criteria identified
in Phase 3. Use the `manage-github-issue` skill for each issue so structured
relationships are wired correctly.

Wire the concern issue as the **parent** of each implementation issue. If the
implementation issues have a natural sequence, wire the later ones as
`--blocked-by` the earlier ones.

Accumulate all created issue numbers in a list:

```bash
IMPL_ISSUE_NUMBERS=()   # will hold one or more issue numbers

NEW_ISSUE=$(
  .agents/skills/manage-github-issue/manage_github_issue.sh \
    --title "<Implementation title from grill-me>" \
    --body "## Summary

<One paragraph describing what needs to be done, derived from grill-me.>

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC-1: <from grill-me>
- [ ] AC-2: <from grill-me>

## Reference

Concern: #${CONCERN_NUMBER}
$([ -n "${SPEC_FILE}" ] && echo "Spec: \`specs/${SPEC_FILE}\`")
$([ -n "${NOTES_FILE}" ] && echo "Notes: \`notes/${NOTES_FILE}\`")" \
    --label "size:<S|M|L>" \
    --parent "${CONCERN_NUMBER}"
    # Add --blocked-by N for sequenced issues
)
IMPL_ISSUE_NUMBERS+=("${NEW_ISSUE}")
echo "Created impl issue #${NEW_ISSUE}"
# Repeat for each additional issue
```

Set `size:` based on AC count: 1–2 → `size:S`; 3–6 → `size:M`; 7+ → `size:L`.

Then add each new issue to Project #24 with `Schedule=Someday`:

```bash
NODE_ID=$(gh api graphql -f query='{
  repository(owner:"CERTCC", name:"Vultron") {
    issue(number: '"${NEW_ISSUE}"') { id }
  }
}' --jq '.data.repository.issue.id')
ITEM_ID=$(gh api graphql -f query="mutation {
  addProjectV2ItemById(input: {
    projectId: \"PVT_kwDOAjf0s84BZnre\"
    contentId: \"${NODE_ID}\"
  }) { item { id } }
}" --jq '.data.addProjectV2ItemById.item.id')
gh api graphql -f query="mutation {
  updateProjectV2ItemFieldValue(input: {
    projectId: \"PVT_kwDOAjf0s84BZnre\"
    itemId: \"${ITEM_ID}\"
    fieldId: \"PVTSSF_lADOAjf0s84BZnrezhUlFOM\"
    value: { singleSelectOptionId: \"fcffa79d\" }
  }) { projectV2Item { id } }
}" >/dev/null
```

### Phase 6 — Lint Markdown (if docs changed)

If Phase 4 modified any files, invoke the `format-markdown` skill on all
new/modified markdown files. Fix all errors before proceeding.

### Phase 7 — Open a Docs-Only PR (if docs changed)

Only if Phase 4 produced file changes:

```bash
git add specs/ notes/ AGENTS.md
git commit -m "docs: ingest concern #${CONCERN_NUMBER} — <short title>

- <bullet: what spec/notes/AGENTS.md was added or changed>
- Concern originated in #${CONCERN_NUMBER}

Co-authored-by: Copilot <223556219+Copilot@users.noreply.github.com>"
git push -u origin ingest/concern-${CONCERN_NUMBER}-<slug>

IMPL_REFS=$(printf 'Implementation tracked in #%s\n' "${IMPL_ISSUE_NUMBERS[@]}" \
  | paste -sd ', ')

gh pr create --repo CERTCC/Vultron \
  --title "docs: ingest concern #${CONCERN_NUMBER} — <short title>" \
  --body "Docs-only PR: addresses concern #${CONCERN_NUMBER} at the spec/notes
level. ${IMPL_REFS}.

Closes #${CONCERN_NUMBER}

No .py files changed." \
  --label "specs-notes"
```

### Phase 8 — Archive and Close the Concern

Invoke the `archive-history` skill now that the PR URL is known:

```text
TYPE    = learning
TITLE   = <short concern title>
SOURCE  = CONCERN-<CONCERN_NUMBER>
BODY    = Full original concern body
          + "**Resolved**: YYYY-MM-DD — implementation tracked in
            #<N> [, #<M> ...]."
          + "Docs PR: <PR_URL>." (if docs-only PR was opened)
```

The `archive-history` skill handles `uv run append-history`, mdlint,
`git add plan/history/`, commit, and push.

Then post a resolution comment and close the concern:

```bash
gh issue comment "${CONCERN_NUMBER}" --repo CERTCC/Vultron \
  --body "✅ Ingested.

$([ -n "${PR_URL}" ] && echo "- Docs PR: ${PR_URL}")
$(for n in "${IMPL_ISSUE_NUMBERS[@]}"; do echo "- Implementation issue: #${n}"; done)

Root cause and fix plan captured via grill-me session.
$([ -n "${SPEC_FILE}" ] && echo "Spec: \`specs/${SPEC_FILE}\`.")
$([ -n "${NOTES_FILE}" ] && echo "Notes: \`notes/${NOTES_FILE}\`.")"

# Only close directly when no docs PR was opened.
# If a PR was created, `Closes #N` in the PR body closes the concern on merge —
# closing it directly here would prematurely close it if the PR is later rejected.
if [ -z "${PR_URL}" ]; then
  gh issue close "${CONCERN_NUMBER}" --repo CERTCC/Vultron
fi
```

## Checklist

- [ ] Concern issue identified (user-specified or selected from list)
- [ ] Concern body fetched from GitHub; issue validated as open + type:Concern
- [ ] Task branch created (if doc gaps identified in grill-me) — before any file writes
- [ ] `study-project-docs` invoked; evidence files explored
- [ ] All grill-me branches resolved (root cause, options, ACs, doc gaps)
- [ ] `specs/` and/or `notes/` updated — or consciously skipped
- [ ] `AGENTS.md` updated — or consciously skipped
- [ ] Markdown lint clean (if docs changed)
- [ ] One or more implementation issues created via `manage-github-issue`
  with `size:` label, added to Project #24 with `Schedule=Someday`;
  concern wired as parent
- [ ] Docs-only PR opened with `specs-notes` label — or skipped (no doc
  changes)
- [ ] Concern archived via `archive-history` skill (after PR creation, so
  entry body includes PR URL); history files staged and pushed to branch
- [ ] Concern issue commented with impl issue(s) + optional PR URL; closed
  **directly** only when no docs PR was opened — if a docs PR was opened,
  the `Closes #N` keyword in the PR body closes the concern on merge

---

## Conventions

- **Branch name**: `ingest/concern-<N>-<slug>` (only created if docs changed)
- **History source ID**: `CONCERN-<github_issue_number>`
  (e.g., `CONCERN-42`)
- **`append-history` command**: use the `archive-history` skill — do not
  call `uv run append-history` directly
  (same category as `learn` — resolved concerns are learning outcomes)
- **Spec file names**: lowercase hyphenated `.yaml` in `specs/`
- **Notes file names**: same base name as spec, `.md` in `notes/`
- **Project board**: Add all new issues to Project #24 ("Vultron Planning")
  with `Schedule=Someday`. Use `review-priorities` to promote them to
  Now/Next/Later when they are ready to be scheduled.
