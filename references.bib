abstract = "Resilience has attracted criticism for its failure to address social vulnerability and to engage with issues of equity and power. Here, we ask: what is equitable resilience? Our focus is on what resilience does on the ground in relation to development, adaptation and disaster management, and on identifying critical issues for engaging with equity in resilience practice. Using techniques from systematic reviews, with variants of equitable resilience as our key search terms, we carried out an analytical literature review which reveals four interconnected themes: subjectivities, inclusion, cross-scale interactions, and transformation. Drawing on this analysis, we find that ‘equitable resilience’ is increasingly likely when resilience practice takes into account issues of social vulnerability and differential access to power, knowledge, and resources; it requires starting from people’s own perception of their position within their human-environmental system, and it accounts for their realities and for their need for a change of circumstance to avoid imbalances of power into the future. Our approach moves beyond debates that focus on the ontological disconnect between resilience and social theory, to provide a definition that can be used in practice alongside resilience indicators to drive ground level interventions towards equitable outcomes. Defined in this way, equitable resilience is able to support the development of social-ecological systems that are contextually rooted, responsive to change and socially just, and thus relevant to global sustainability challenges."

        abstract = {The principle of indifference (PI) states that in the absence of any relevant evidence, a rational agent will distribute their credence (or `degrees of belief') equally amongst all the possible outcomes under consideration. Despite its intuitive plausibility, PI famously falls prey to paradox, and so is widely rejected as a principle of ideal rationality. Some authors have attempted to show that by conceiving of the epistemic states of agents in terms of imprecise credences, it is possible to overcome these paradoxes and thus to achieve a consistent rehabilitation of PI. In this article, I present an alternative rehabilitation of PI in terms of the epistemology of comparative confidence judgements of the form `I am more confident in the truth of p than I am in the truth q' or `I am equally confident in the truth of p and q'. In particular, I consider two natural comparative reformulations of PI, and argue that while one of them prescribes the adoption of patently irrational epistemic states, the other (which is only available when we drop the standard but controversial `Opinionation' assumption from the comparative confidence framework) provides a consistent formulation of PI that overcomes the fundamental limitations of all existing formulations.}

    abstract = { AbstractToy models are highly idealized and extremely simple models. Although they are omnipresent across scientific disciplines, toy models are a surprisingly under-appreciated subject in the philosophy of science. The main philosophical puzzle regarding toy models concerns what the epistemic goal of toy modelling is. One promising proposal for answering this question is the claim that the epistemic goal of toy models is to provide individual scientists with understanding. The aim of this article is to precisely articulate and to defend this claim. In particular, we will distinguish between autonomous and embedded toy models, and then argue that important examples of autonomous toy models are sometimes best interpreted to provide how-possibly understanding, while embedded toy models yield how-actually understanding, if certain conditions are satisfied. 1 Introduction2 Embedded and Autonomous Toy Models  2.1 Embedded toy models  2.2 Autonomous toy models  2.3 Qualification3 A Theory of Understanding for Toy Models  3.1 Preliminaries and requirements  3.2 The refined simple view4 Two Kinds of Understanding with Toy Models  4.1 Embedded toy models and how-actually understanding  4.2 Against a how-actually interpretation of all autonomous toy models  4.3 The how-possibly interpretation of some autonomous toy models5 Conclusion }

A great deal of the discussion is centred on approximation, idealisation, and on how these models achieve their representational function. Despite the importance, distinct nature, and high presence of toy models, they have received little attention from philosophers. This paper hopes to remedy this situation. It aims to elevate the status of toy models: by distinguishing them from approximations and idealisations, by highlighting and elaborating on several ways the Kac ring, a simple statistical mechanical model, is used as a toy model, and by explaining why toy models can be used to successfully carry out important work without performing a representational function.}

    abstract = "{Despite significant innovations in IT security products and research over the past 20 years, the information security field is still immature and struggling. Practitioners lack the ability to properly assess cyber risk, and decision-makers continue to be paralyzed by vulnerability scanners that overload their staff with mountains of scan results. In order to cope, firms prioritize vulnerability remediation using crude heuristics and limited data, though they are still too often breached by known vulnerabilities for which patches have existed for months or years. And so, the key challenge firms face is trying to identify a remediation strategy that best balances two competing forces. On one hand, it could attempt to patch all vulnerabilities on its network. While this would provide the greatest ‘coverage’ of vulnerabilities patched, it would inefficiently consume resources by fixing low-risk vulnerabilities. On the other hand, patching a few high-risk vulnerabilities would be highly ‘efficient’, but may leave the firm exposed to many other high-risk vulnerabilities. Using a large collection of multiple datasets together with machine learning techniques, we construct a series of vulnerability remediation strategies and compare how each perform in regard to trading off coverage and efficiency. We expand and improve upon the small body of literature that uses predictions of ‘published exploits’, by instead using ‘exploits in the wild’ as our outcome variable. We implement the machine learning models by classifying vulnerabilities according to high- and low-risk, where we consider high-risk vulnerabilities to be those that have been exploited in actual firm networks.}",
