# Conclusion {#sec:conclusion}

In this report, we developed a state-based model of the
CVD process that
enables us to enumerate all possible CVD histories $\mathcal{H}$ and defined a set
of desired criteria $\mathbb{D}$ that are preferable in each history.
This allowed us to create a partially ordered set over all histories and
to compute a baseline expected frequency for each desired criteria. We
also proposed a new performance indicator for comparing actual
CVD experiences
against a benchmark, and proposed an initial benchmark based on the
expected frequency of each desired criteria. We demonstrated this
performance indicator in a few examples, indicating that at least some
CVD practices
appear to be doing considerably better than random. Finally, we posited
a way to apply these metrics to measure the efficacy of
MPCVD processes.

The resulting state-transition model has numerous applications to
formalizing the specification of CVD policies and processes. We discussed how
the model can be used to specify embargo and disclosure policies, and to
bring consistency to coordination practices. We further showed how the
model can be used to reduce uncertainty regarding actions to take even
in the presence of incomplete CVD information. We also suggested how the
model can be used to normalize frequently-used terms that have lacked
consistent definitions among practitioners of CVD and VM. Finally, we demonstrated the potential
application of this model to US VEP scope definitions.

In combination, the model described in this report offers a way to
observe, communicate, and measure the quality improvement of
CVD and
MPCVD practices
across the board.
