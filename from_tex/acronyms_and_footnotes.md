    patches could achieve $\mathbf{D} \prec \mathbf{P}$ even in
    traditional COTS or OSS distribution models. However, in practice
    silent patches result in poor deployment rates precisely because
    they lack an explicit imperative to deploy the fix.

    context of scientific publications. Like CVD embargoes, the use of scientific news
    embargoes is not without controversy.

    utilitarianism is even the best way to approach these problems; and
    if it is, which variety of utilitarianism may be best suited. Such
    topics, while both interesting and relevant, lie too far afield from
    our main topic for us to to them justice here. We direct interested
    readers toward [@sep-utilitarianism-history] as an introduction to
    the general topic.
