# Acknowledgments {#acknowledgments .unnumbered}

We offer our sincere gratitude to the United States Senators, Members of
Congress, and their staffs, whose insightful questions surrounding the
coordinated disclosure of the Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities
prompted us to recognize the need for a better way to reason about and
describe what "good" vulnerability disclosure outcomes look like.

We also thank the anonymous reviewers at the ACM Journal *Digital
Threats: Research and Practice* for their helpful feedback on an earlier
version of this report.

CERT/CC staff were instrumental in reviewing and providing feedback on
the model described in this report as it developed. We are grateful for
the opportunity to have them as colleagues.
